# Download Data

## Downloading Data from PATRIC

Data, in multiple formats and file types, may be downloaded from PATRIC
in the following ways:

-   You can download DNA sequence of any specified genomic region using
    the Genome Browser. Please see the [Genome
    Browser](/content/Genome_Browser) user guide.
-   Most PATRIC tables contain a Table Toolbar, located in the light
    blue row, which can be used to download selected DNA and/or protein
    sequence data in FASTA format or to download the table itself as
    either an excel or txt file. For more information on using Table
    Toolbars, see the [Feature Table](/content/Feature_Table) user
    guide.
-   You may also permanently save selected items to groups within your
    Workspace by clicking the Add Feature(s) button, also located in the
    Table Toolbar. To learn more about how to save data for future
    visits and utilize your personal Workspace please see the
    [Workspace](/content/Workspace_and_Groups) user guide.
