Genome Data and Tools
==================================

The central data type in PATRIC is genomes. Most of the data and
information within PATRIC is related back to sequenced, assembled, and
annotated genomes stored in the PATRIC database. Genomes are
incorporated from RefSeq, GenBank, and other sources, and are annotated
using a standard annotation protocol, RASTtk, to enable comparative
analyses and linking of data across the website.
