Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) has the potential to become an important molecular epidemiologic tool as it provides information about the microevolution of a strain during transmission as well as the source(s) of infection and the sequence of transmission events. This will be important as it can distinguish patients who are part of a recent chain of transmission from those with disease resulting from progression of remote infection. Moreover, WGS can be used in areas where the isolates causing TB are genetically similar (prevalent M. tuberculosis stains) and where current tools cannot distinguish between recent transmission and prevalent strains.

About 3.7% of new tuberculosis (TB) patients in the world have multidrug-resistant strains (MDR-TB). Levels are much higher in those previously treated â€“ about 20%. The frequency of MDR-TB varies substantially between countries. About 9% of MDR-TB cases also have resistance to two other classes of drugs, or extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB).
