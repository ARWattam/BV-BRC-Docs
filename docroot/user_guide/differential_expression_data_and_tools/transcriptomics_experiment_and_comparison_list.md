# Transcriptomics Experiments and Comparisons List


## Transcriptomics Experiment and Comparison Lists Overview {#transcriptomics-experiment-and-comparison-lists-overview .ribbon-title}

For any taxonomy level or genome, all publically available
transcriptomics experiment datasets that are incorporated into PATRIC
are displayed as Experiment and Comparison lists. The Experiment Tab
shows a list of studies or datasets that contain one or more samples or
experimental conditions. The Comparison Tab shows a list of curated
pair-wise comparisons of two samples or experimental conditions to
provide differential gene expression measurements. Metadata-based
searching and progressive filtering allows you to quickly find datasets
of interest.

## Accessing Transcriptomics Experiment and Condition Lists

Experiment and Comparison lists can be accessed via the Transcriptomics
tab on any Taxonomy or Genome level landing page.

## Using Transcriptomics Experiment and Condition Lists

-   All tables accessed via the Experiments and Comparisons Tabs may be
    sorted as described in [Feature Table FAQs](/content/Feature_Table).
-   Filter controls on the left allow you to filter the data based on
    the following key metadata attributes (in orange text): Sample
    Organism, Strain, Gene modification, Experimental condition, Time
    series, and Release date. To see all of the information associated
    with a specific attribute in the list, click the “more” buttons,
    located within the list.
-   From the Experiments tab, using links provided in a row, you can
    navigate to an individual experiment landing page (Title), Gene List
    (Genes), publication page at NCBI PubMed (PubMed), or detailed
    experiment page at NCBI’s GEO database (Link Out).
-   From the Comparisons tab, using links provided in a row, you can
    navigate to corresponding Gene List (Genes), list of significant
    genes based on log ratio (|Log Ratio| &gt;= 1), list of significant
    genes based on Z-score (|Z-score| &gt;=2), publication page at NCBI
    PubMed (PubMed), or detailed experiment page at NCBI GEO database
    (Link Out).
-   From either tab, you can use the Table Toolbar, located in the light
    blue row to:
    -   Select one or more Experiments or Comparisons of interest and
        save them to your workspace as a group by clicking the Add
        Experiments button. Creating a group from the Comparisons tab
        will add the entire Experiment to your workspace.
        -   Note: If you are a registered PATRIC user and logged in,
            your Experiment group(s) will be permanently saved to your
            workspace. To learn more about the benefits of registration,
            and how to save data for future visits and utilize your
            personal workspace, see [Registration FAQs](/content/Registration) and [Workspace FAQs](/content/Workspace_and_Groups).
    -   Select one or more Experiments or Comparisons and create a Gene
        List.
    -   Download selected Experiment data in both excel and txt file
        formats.
    -   Customize which metadata columns are shown/hidden in your
        results table with the Columns button.
    -   Access the PATRIC FAQs glossary within PATRIC eNews by clicking
        on the PATRIC FAQs button.
