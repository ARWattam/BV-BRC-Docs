PATRIC January 2016 Release Features Over 2400 New Genomes
==========================================================

.. feed-entry::
   :date: 2016-02-02

In this release, we have added 2466 new genomes from NCBI GenBank,
bringing the total number of genomes in PATRIC to over 57,000. This
release utilizes our newly deployed continuous release process wherein
we can release genomes into the database in near real-time from
acquisition from GenBank and other sources. Â The full list of available
bacterial genomes can be accessed from the `Genomes Tab for all
bacteria <https://www.patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/GenomeList?cType=taxon&cId=2&dataSource=&displayMode=&pk=&kw=>`__,
and from the `Genomes Data Landing
Page <https://www.patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/Genomes>`__.

We have incorporated TnSeq data and processed results into PATRIC from
the Functionalizing Lists of Unknown TB Entities (FLUTE), part of the
`NIAID Functional Genomics
Program <http://www.niaid.nih.gov/labsandresources/resources/dmid/uncharacterizedgenes/Pages/default.aspx>`__,
including integrated feature annotations, where provided. Summaries of
and links to these data can be accessed from the `PATRIC FLUTE
page <http://enews.patricbrc.org/functionalizing-lists-of-unknown-tb-entities-flute/>`__.
