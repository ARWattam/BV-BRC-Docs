# Serology Data

## Overview
Serum samples were collected from avian, non-human mammalian, and human subjects and tested for the presence of antibodies to specific influenza serotypes. The serotypes detected in the serum are identified in the search result. 

## Accessing Serology data

Serology data can be accessed through multiple routes in the BV-BRC: 

1\. Specifically searching for serology data using the search bar.
