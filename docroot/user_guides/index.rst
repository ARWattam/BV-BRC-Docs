PATRIC User Guides
===================

The PATRIC website provides an entry point to integrated data and tools
for bacterial infectious disease research. The website is organized by
data types and analysis tools. Primary access is provided through the
PATRIC main menu, available at the top of the home page. The main menu
options are the following:

-  `Organisms <organisms_tab.html>`_ - links to bacterial data sorted into genera. On each
   organism page, further divisions of data types are available from the
   data tabs such as Overview, Taxonomy, Phylogeny, Genome List, Feature
   Table, Specialty Genes, etc.
-  `Data <data.html>`_ - links to specialized "Data Landing Pages" that provide
   overview and summary information of PATRIC data, including pages for
   Antibiotic Resistance, Genomes, Genome Features, Pathways, Protein
   Families, Specialty Genes, Transcriptomics, and special featured data
   sets.
-  `Workspaces <workspaces.html>`_ - links to the private workspace and subdirectories in the
   private workspace.

   Currently, services are available for processing user-supplied data
   including Genome Assembly, Genome Annotation, BLAST, Variation
   Analysis, Expression Data Integration, RNA-Seq Analysis, Protein
   Family Sorter, Proteome Comparison, Pathway Comparison, and Model
   Reconstruction.
-  Help - links to pages containing a PATRIC Quickstart video,
   Tutorials, User Guides, and information to Provide Feedback.
-  `Global Search <global_search.html>`_ - searches PATRIC databases to quickly locate genomes, genes, and other information via keywords.
-  `Registration <registration.html>`_ - allows creation of a PATRIC account, enabling use of PATRIC services and a private workspace. 
-  Other information (the three-line "hamburger" icon on the top right
   of the page) - links to pages containing additional information such
   as News, Publications, About PATRIC, Citing PATRIC, Scientific
   Working Group, Personnel, Collaborators, Related Sites, and System
   Architecture.
-  `Views, Tables, Action Bar <views_tables_action-bar.html>`_ - Common navigation elements and tools throughout the website. 
-  `System Requirements <system_requirements.html>`_ - Minimal hardware and software needs for the user's computer in order to be able to use PATRIC's features and functionality successfully.
