We have released a series of new video tutorials for PATRIC services and associated functionality. Each tutorial features a set of short instructional videos that provide a step-by-step of how to use a PATRIC analysis service, from beginning to end. The first series focuses on genome assembly, annotation, and common comparative genomic analyses in PATRIC.
