The Bioinformatic Resource Centers (BRC) have partnered to present a joint webinar series on Respiratory Pathogens and the tools available for their study. 

.. cut::

While much of the scientific focus of attention has been on the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, we will discuss other pathogens that may cause respiratory illness, or even co-occur with SARS-CoV-2. The Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center, (BV-BRC) will discuss viral and bacterial pathogens, whereas The Eukaryotic Pathogen, Host & Vector Genomics Resource (VEuPathDB), will focus on fungal pathogens and host response. Webinars will be structured to include a brief basic biology refresher on the pathogen of interest and a live demo of available tools for in silico research.

A special guest speaker will also be featured during each session. The IRD and ViPR will focus on the following viral families: Orthomyxoviridae (Influenza), Coronaviridae (various human coronavirus species), Pneumoviridae (RSV), and Picornaviridae (Enterovirus). Our counterparts at the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC) will discuss bacterial respiratory pathogens and antibacterial resistance, and showcase PATRICâ€™s bioinformatic tools. Finally our partners at VEuPathDB, will present data on Aspergillus and Candida, and introduce users to bioinformatic resources available at FungiDB and HostDB. A schedule is provided below.
