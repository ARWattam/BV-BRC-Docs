# PATRIC Privacy Policy

The PATRIC Bioinformatics Resource Center is provided as a public resource for the research community. This Privacy Policy describes the ways PATRIC collects, stores, uses, discloses and protects the personal information about users and how they use PATRIC. A link to this policy appears in the footer of patricbrc.org webpage and other prominent locations such as the Registration page where it must be acknowledged to obtain a PATRIC User Account. PATRIC never collects information for commercial marketing or any purpose unrelated to PATRIC functions.

## Information PATRIC collects
Some functions of PATRIC may be used without a PATRIC User Account, in which case PATRIC does collect some information about your visit to the website to help understand how it is used and might be improved. If you choose to have a PATRIC User Account you are asked to provide your name and an email address so we may contact you if needed. This information is also in your personal profile, which is private unless you choose to make it public.

PATRIC Account Names are not treated as personal information and it is recommended that you not include personal information in your account name.

## User-provided personal information and data
You may at your discretion also provide in your personal profile further biographical information including a profile image, your real name, education, position, affiliations (both institutional and interpersonal, i.e., colleagues), funding, phone numbers, email addresses, publications, group membership, user external account references (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, home page), user PATRIC account status, PATRIC activity, followers/following.

PATRIC does not track information in your personal research data other than to provide indexing to support your searches, and verify that the data and its use adheres to the User Agreement. Access to this information is strictly under your control to share or make public.

Once data or narratives are designated as shared or public, you should be aware that other users of PATRIC will be able to use them.

## User behavioral profile
When you visit PATRIC or use its services, usage information is automatically recorded by your account name including what services you used as well as information such as your computer’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and operating system, the web page you were visiting and visit over time on PATRIC.us, information searched for, access times and dates, what resources are consumed (CPU, disk, etc); all acts of creating Narratives and data, sharing Narratives or resources, uploading data files, input and output from PATRIC services, user input to Narrative cells, input to any future rating systems or ‘liking’, linking to or citing other Narratives, URLs, or references; user comments; and information learned from user activity such as common parameters for services, frequently used services, combinations of services, frequently used datasets, and the number of times a Narrative is copied, cloned, or referenced by others.

## How information collected by PATRIC is used
Private personal information is only accessible to PATRIC staff and will only be used individually in the event we need to contact you. If you choose to provide that information to PATRIC independently (for example when emailing to request help), again it will only be used by PATRIC staff for the purpose of responding. PATRIC will produce project reports that include aggregate information such as the number of help requests, statistics on the topics of requests and resolutions, and analyses of the institutions and types of users such as can be derived from email addresses. Additionally, the ways users interact with the system are analyzed when errors occur and in aggregate for analysis of PATRIC operation and improvement.

Aggregated usage information based on user behavior is used by PATRIC to produce overall statistics such as to show users which Apps are most popular. Usage information is also used by PATRIC for internal purposes such as to manage and improve capabilities and services, the website and related features and content, and to enable users to easily and productively navigate the website and utilize PATRIC capabilities for research benefit.

Aggregated usage analyses do not link to individual personal information but may include results broken down by aggregated personal information for example geographic region or type of institution of those users who have shared their profile publicly.

Users should also understand that once their research data is made public that PATRIC reserves the right to integrate this information into meta-analyses that the PATRIC system might perform.

## Information PATRIC discloses
PATRIC is committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and security of users’ personal private information and data. PATRIC considers this information to be private and held in confidence or shared as designated under user control until a user makes it public.

Usage information is used for privately reporting to our funding agency, the Genomic Science program of the Biological Systems Science Division of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Biological and Environmental Research (DOE), for the purpose of evaluating the performance of the overall project. No individually identifiable information is reported or disclosed.

## How information PATRIC collects is protected
PATRIC restricts access to nonpublic, personal information to those staff and service providers involved in administering and servicing user accounts. Physical, electronic and procedural safeguards are in place that comply with federal standards to protect such information.

## Changes to this policy
This PATRIC Privacy Policy may change from time to time. Your rights under this policy will not be reduced without your explicit consent. Changes will be posted on this page, and if significant will be provided more prominently via email or notification when you sign in.

Users may at any time review, update, correct or delete the personal information in their profiles by signing in to their PATRIC account and using the edit or remove functions available from their personal profile page.
