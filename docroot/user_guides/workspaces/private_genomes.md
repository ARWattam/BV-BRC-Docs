# Private Genomes

## Overview
PATRIC allows users to have their own private genomes stored in the workspace and also available integrated with the rest of the PATRIC public genome data to enable comparative analysis.

## Creating and Accessing Private Genomes on the PATRIC Website
A private genome is automatically created as a result of running the Genome Annotation Service, and will appear by default in the MyGenomes folder. A different folder can be selected from the input form if desired before running the service.

Once the genome annotation has completed, the results can be accessed by double-clicking the MyGenomes (or other chosen) folder, which will display a list of the job results. 

![MyGenomes List](../images/mygenomes_list.png)

The results page will consist of a header describing the genome annotation job and a list of output files. Details of the job results output are provided in the [Genome Annotation Service User Guide](https://docs.patricbrc.org//user_guides/services/genome_annotation_service.html)



## Using Private Genomes in the PATRIC Website

## Genome Sharing
It is possible to share a genome annoted using the PATRIC Genome Annotation Service with specified other registered users. This allows these other users to interact with the genome in the PATRIC system in the same way as the user who originally annotated the genome.



## Sharing Genomes on the PATRIC website

When logged in, clicking on the "My Genomes" option in the Workspaces top menu displays the list of genomes that have been annotated using the Genome Annotation Service.

Selecting one or more of the genomes in the table enables the "Share" button in the vertical green Action Bar on the right side of the table.

Clicking the Share button opens a dialog box for selecting other users with whom to share the genome.
