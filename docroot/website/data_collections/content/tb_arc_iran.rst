`TB-ARC Iran at Broad <https://olive.broadinstitute.org/projects/tb_iran>`_

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Iran is a country with an intermediate rate of TB incidence. Although, with the recent emergence of extensively and totally drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR or TDR) strains, the situation has become more alarming. Basically, Iran has a common border with high TB burden countries like Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan. As a result, the country is suffering from a variable microbial epidemic. From 2006 onwards, the NRL of Iran, were focused on clinical and laboratory importance of XDR and TDR-TB bacilli. These bacilli (XDR and TDR) were observed under AFM, TEM and Scanning electron microscopes. Our results showed considerable changes in morphology, cell division and cell wall thickness. But whether these changes occurred at genetic level and transferred to the next generation remains to be resolved. In this project, we are aiming to do whole genome sequencing of MDR, XDR and TDR strains and compare the data with susceptible isolates. The identifying mutation or deletion may open a new path in better understanding the resistant phenomena. Also, to find out if a harsh environment [i.e., low oxygen and nutrients or a high cocktail of antibiotics] could draw the bacilli into similar type of adaptation, we would like to analyze and compare the genomic sequences of latent H37RV with TDR-TB strains.

We will also sequence and analyze two strains of H37Rv under different conditions, to access latency in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Latent tuberculosis is a clinical syndrome that occurs after an individual has been exposed to M. tuberculosis. Following initial infection, the bacilli typically replicate inside host macrophages until an effective immune response is mounted and the bacilli become restricted to the characteristic tuberculous lesions and the progression of the diseases is halted. In these individuals, the bacilli persist in a dormant state, from which they may reactivate and induce clinical disease at later stages. The physiological state in which M. tuberculosis survives in the lesions is largely unknown. Several years ago, Wayne et al. described an in vitro model of latency. In this model, mycobacterium cultures are gradually depleted of oxygen. Wayne showed that growth under oxygen depletion conditions lead to two non-replicating, persistent (NRP) states: a microaerophilic (NRP1) and a later anaerobic state (NRP2). In recent years, most of the phenotypic changes that occur in NRP1 and NRP2 states were demonstrated, but beyond NRP2 state i.e. 9 months after latency, the information was limited. In an effort to understand what happens to bacteria during latent infection, we will trigger a latency response in TB bacilli using in vitro gradual oxygen depletion model. Based on documented morphological changes and susceptibility patterns (H37Rv became resistant to RF) in latent state, we want to determine if there are genetic differences that have occurred in these cells. For this reason, the whole genome of latent H37Rv will be analyzed and compared with usual H37Rv. The information will guide us to resolve questions regarding the latency in TB.
