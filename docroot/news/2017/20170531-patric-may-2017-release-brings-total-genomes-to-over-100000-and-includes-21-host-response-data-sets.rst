**New Genomes**

In this release, PATRIC has added over 7,700 new genomes, bringing the
total number of public genomes in PATRIC to 103,779 bacterial, 1,078
archeal, and 10 eukaryotic host. This is a notable milestone for the
project, especially considering that the database contained only 400
bacterial genomes at the end of 2009, when PATRIC launched the all
bacteria Bioinformatics Resource Center. The full list of available
bacterial genomes can be accessed from the `Genomes Tab for all
bacteria <https://www.patricbrc.org/view/Taxonomy/2#view_tab=genomes>`__.

**Host Response Data Sets**

In this release, PATRIC now includes 21 curated host-response gene
expression datasets, 19 of which are from `Expression
Atlas <http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/home>`__ and 2 from the `Omics4TB NIAID
Systems Biology
Center <https://www.patricbrc.org/webpage/website/data_collections/content/omics4tb.html>`__.   All datasets
were processed and incorporated into PATRIC using our enhanced
`Expression Import
Service <https://www.patricbrc.org/app/Expression>`__. In PATRIC, users
can view experiments and related metadata, select one or more
experiments and generate interactive gene lists, visualize the data in a
heatmap, and find patterns using clustering. Experiments and
corresponding gene lists are also accessible via cross-BRC data API. The
host response data sets can be accessed from the Transcriptomics tab for
*`Mus
musculus <https://www.patricbrc.org/view/Genome/10090.24#view_tab=transcriptomics>`__*
and *`Homo
sapiens <https://www.patricbrc.org/view/Genome/9606.33#view_tab=transcriptomics>`__*.
