# PATRIC Jobs

## Overview
For most PATRIC services, when the service starts, it creates a computational "job" that runs on back-end high-performance computers which perform the analysis and return the results back to the user. The reason for this is that many services, such as Genome Annotation and Genome Assembly, require a significant amount of computational power and time. The job display provides information on the status of the computation: started, completed, or failed.

## Creating Private Genomes on the PATRIC Website
A private genome is automatically created as a result of running the Genome Annotation Service. See the [Genome Annotation Service User Guide](../services/genome_annotation_service.html) for details.

## Accessing and Using Private Genomes in the PATRIC Website
Upon successful completion of an annotation job, the resulting annotated genome is integrated into the other genome data in PATRIC, but is only viewable by the owner (submitter) of the annotation job. This integration allows use of all the PATRIC genome display and analysis tools, including comparisons with other genomes in PATRIC.
