PATRIC provides a service that allows researchers to compare annotated proteins by bi-directional BLASTP analysis. The Proteome Comparison tool can be used to examine up to compare nine genomes to single reference, which can be a genome that has been annotated in PATRIC or from an independent source, or a group of proteins. A recorded webinar that demonstrates this service is now available on the PATRICBRC YouTube site at <https://youtu.be/sozy1mJh1EI>
