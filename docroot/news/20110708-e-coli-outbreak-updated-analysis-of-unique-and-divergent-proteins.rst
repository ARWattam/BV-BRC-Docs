E. coli Outbreak: Updated Analysis of Unique and Divergent Proteins
===================================================================

Nine *Escherichia coli* strains were included in the latest analyses:
TY-2482 (complete assembly), LB226692, GOS1, GOS2, H112180280,
H112180282, H112180283, H112180540, and H112180541.  The proteins from
these strains were used to search a specific *E. coli* database
(compiled with 184 *E. coli* genomes at PATRIC) using BLAST.  We
calculated Smith-Waterman alignment scores for each of the top ten
best-scoring homologs of these proteins and normalized the score to the
self-alignment score, creating a conformity score.  Conformity scores of
1 indicate that all proteins in the alignment are identical.  Proteins
with conformity scores of 0.8 or less are considered to be “divergent”
from their top ten homologs in *E. coli*.  A graphical representation
showing conformity scores for proteins of the nine *E. coli* strains is
provided in the figure below.

A list of all proteins and their conformity scores is provided in an
Excel file
(`ecoli9genocav <http://enews.patricbrc.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/ecoli9genocav.xls>`__). 
Some of the proteins found in the outbreak strains have no homologs in
*E. coli*.  In the conformity score column, these “unique” proteins are
identified by a “-“.  The data for the unique proteins for all nine
strains are also integrated into the PATRIC website, with the additional
functionality the site provides (where applicable); you can access those
data at the following links:

The divergent proteins (see above) were compared to virulence and
antibiotic-resistance proteins collected from different sources with
some interesting discoveries.  For example, beta-lactamase, a protein
responsible for resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics like penicillins,
cephamycins, and carbapenems was found to be identical in the nine
outbreak strains (CTX-M type), but very different from their closest
homologs prevalent in other *E. coli* strains (TEM-type).  An alignment
of these proteins is shown
`here <http://www.patricbrc.org/patric/html/ehec_2011.html#alignment>`__. 
Other divergent proteins include ABC transporters, phage-related and
outer-membrane proteins.
