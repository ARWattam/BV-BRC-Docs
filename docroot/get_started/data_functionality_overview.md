# BV-BRC Data and Functionality Overview 
## (A Guide for PATRIC Users)

BV-BRC has been developed by using the legacy PATRIC data, tools, services, website, and infrastructure, and augmenting it with integrated viral data, tools, and features from the legacy IRD (influenza) and ViPR (other pathgenic viruses) BRCs. PATRIC users Will be able to do all of the same searches, analyses, workspace that they have at PATRIC. Now there are additional data, tools, and services at their disposal for more comprehensive analysis. A few changes in website layout and terminology have been made to assist IRD/ViPR users in make the transition.  Summaries of the changes are presented below. 

## Data 

### Organisms

### Genomes
Bacterial data (~500K annotated bacterial genomes and associated data) have been augmented with a comparable volume of viral data (~5M viral genomes and associated data). Many of the viral genomes have additional metadata fields, which have be been added to the overall set.
