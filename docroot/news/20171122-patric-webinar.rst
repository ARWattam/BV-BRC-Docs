   :date: 2017-11-22

PATRIC now provides a new service that builds phylogenetic trees. The trees, which can include both private and public
data, are built using well-established methods for generating whole-genome phylogenies from amino acid sequences. On
November 30th at 3pm EST we will provide a webinar demonstrates this service. Please email rwattam@vt.edu if you plan to
attend so that we will know approximately how many participants to expect.
