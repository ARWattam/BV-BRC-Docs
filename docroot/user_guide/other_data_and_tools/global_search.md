# Global Search

PATRIC provides a global search capability to quickly locate data of
interest. The Search box is available on the right side of the menu bar
at the top of each PATRIC page. Features of the Global Search include:

-   Top matches, sorted by data types, including genomes, genomic
    features, taxa, specialty genes, and transcriptomics experiments.
    Clicking on the number beside the data type section headers returns
    all matching data for that type.
-   Data type specific searches. Pre-filter results to specific data
    types by clicking the down arrow on the left side of the search box.
-   Add additional search conditions using keywords AND, OR, and
    parentheses '( )'. Note that multiple search terms are 'AND'ed
    together by default (each term must be in the item for it to have a
    match). Return only exact matches to the search term by enclosing it
    in quotes
-   Search a specific data field for a particular value by using
    field:value in the search box. For example, entering
    genome\_id:123434.3 will search only the genome\_id field in the
    database for the term "123434.3"
