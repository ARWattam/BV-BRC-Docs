The Pathogen Portal team at the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute (VBI)
has announced the release of Mouse Model Strain Selection Guide to
help infectious disease researchers select good mouse models for their
studies.  The Pathogen Portal team has worked with \ `Dr. Carol
Bult <http://research.jax.org/faculty/carol_bult.html>`__ at `the
Jackson Laboratory <http://www.jax.org/>`__ (JAX) to develop this
summarized mouse model selection table for the NIAID category A-C
priority pathogens.  Highlights of this release include:

-  The guide provides the list of resistant, susceptible and humanized
   mouse models used in the infection studies.
-  Pathogens (bacteria, eukaryotic pathogens and viruses) are linked out
   directly to their corresponding BRC websites (PATRIC, EuPathDB, ViPR
   and IRD).
-  Mouse strains selected for the pathogen infection studies are linked
   out to the JAX mice database for detailed mouse strain information
   and purchasing information (if any).
-  The PubMed and Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) references are
   provided.
