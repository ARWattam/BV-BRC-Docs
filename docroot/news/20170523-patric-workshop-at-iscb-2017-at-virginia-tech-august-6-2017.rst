PATRIC will be hosting a 1-day workshop entitled “The PATRIC
Bioinformatics Resource Center for ‘Omics Data Analysis,” at the 18th
International Conference on Systems Biology (ICSB 2017) on August 6,
2017 on the Virginia Tech University campus in Blacksburg, VA. The
workshop will cover PATRIC’s analysis pipelines, which include genome
assembly and annotation, RNA-Seq analysis, variation analysis, and tools
for comparative genomic analysis.  PATRIC provides researchers with the
ability to analyze their private data directly with any of the available
public data.

The registration page for ICSB
is \ http://www.cpe.vt.edu/icsb2017/registration.html, and registration
is open until August 3, 2017.

Participants must bring their own laptops.   The following system
