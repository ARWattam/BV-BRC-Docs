# Circular Genome Viewer

## Accessing the Circular Genome Viewer on the PATRIC Website

Each Organism on PATRIC has an Organism Landing Page. To get to this
page at the Genus level, select your Genera of interest from the
Organisms tab on the PATRIC homepage. The phylogeny of each Landing Page
is listed across the top of the page. Once on the Genera Landing Page,
you may access the Circular Genome Viewer by drilling down in one of the
following ways to either the Genome or the Feature level:

-   Select the Genomes tab, select your Genome of interest from the
    table, and click on the Genome icon from the green action bar. This
    will take you to the chosen Genome View Landing Page. Click on the
    Circular Viewer tab to access to the Tool.
-   Select the Genomes tab, select your Genome of interest from the
    table. Press and hold on the Genome icon from the green action bar.
    This will provide you a drop down selections. Select the Circular
    Viewer from the list to access to the Tool.

-   Select the Features tab, select your Genome of interest from the
    table, and click on the Genome icon from the green action bar. This
    will take you to the chosen Genome View Landing Page. Click on the
    Circular Viewer tab to access to the Tool.
-   Select the Features tab, select your Genome of interest from the
    table. Press and hold on the Genome icon from the green action bar.
    This will provide you a drop down selections. Select the Circular
    Viewer from the list to access to the Tool.

## Circular Genome Viewer

The Circular Genome Viewer is a circular graphical representation of the
alignment of genes and other genomic data.

### Circular Genome Viewer Features and Functionality

Circular Genome Viewer Main Window:

-   mouse over or mouse click on a contig in the circular graph to view
    the genome information.
-   mouse over or mouse click on a feature in the circular graph to view
    the feature information.

Available Tracks Panel

-   The Available Tracks Panel on left lists all available tracks in the
    circular viewer.
-   You may click on the Eye icon to show/hide the tracks.
