# Protein Family Sorter Service Tutorial

## Overview
This set of short videos provides a step-by-step demonstration of using the PATRIC Protein Family Sorter to analyze protein families across a set of closely related bacterial genomes. From these videos you will learn how to do the following:

* Use the global search and the genome groups to select a set of genomes for analysis 
* Initiate a Protein Family Sorter Service job
* Use the Protein Family Sorter tabular and heatmap features to analyze the job results
* Download heatmap data
* Use other tools such as Compare Region Viewer, Genome Browser, and BLAST to further interpret the results
