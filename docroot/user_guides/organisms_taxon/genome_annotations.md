# Genome Annotations

## Annotation sources

PATRIC provides two basic annotation sources, RefSeq, and PATRIC. RefSeq
sequences from NCBI, have each been annotated by the submitting
researcher using methodologies of their choice. PATRIC re-annotates all
genomes using RAST tool kit
[(RASTtk)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4322359/) to
provide annotation consistency across a wide variety of genomes. The
original RefSeq annotations have been retained and are still available
for comparison purposes.

Genomes that are in more than 500 contigs are not annotated by RAST. Nor
are plasmid-only genomes. There is approximately a two-month interval
between when sequences are submitted to RefSeq and
re-annotation/integration with PATRIC, thus there may be a significant
difference in the number of genomes at NCBI and at PATRIC.
