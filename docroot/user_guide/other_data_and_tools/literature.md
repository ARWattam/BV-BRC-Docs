## Accessing Literature on the PATRIC Website {#accessing-literature-on-the-patric-website .ribbon-title}

You may access literature from any Organism Landing Page by clicking on
the “Literature” tab at the top of the page. Note: You will receive
literature relevant to the taxonomic level of the Landing Page. Taxonomy
is listed across the top of the page, directly under the blue banner.

PATRIC searches PubMed directly for literature related to the taxonomic
level shown at the top of the page. PubMed abstracts are available and
you may also link out to any article directly on PubMed. These search
results may be filtered along the left of the page by date and keyword.
