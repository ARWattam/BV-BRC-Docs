# Recorded Webinar: Protein Family Sorter
Exploring the Pan-Proteome and Pathway Differences with PATRIC'S Protein Family Sorter.

## Description
The Protein Family Sorter Service enables comparison of the distribution of protein families across a set of user-selected genomes. Results are displayed in a page showing all the families associated with the selected genomes, plus filter controls and an interactive heatmap. This webinar will provide an overview of how to use the service using an example analysis.
