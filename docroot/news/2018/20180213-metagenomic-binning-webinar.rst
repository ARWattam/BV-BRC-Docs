PATRIC Webinar â€“ Metagenomic Binning Service, Wednesday February 28, 2018, 3:00pm EST (20:00 GMT)
=================================================================================================

PATRIC provides a new Metagenomic Binning Service that accepts either reads or contigs, and attempts to "bin" the data into a set of genomes. It can be used to reconstruct bacterial and archael genomes from environmental samples. The new service will produce reports that estimate the quality of the reconstructed genome for each bin, as well as potentially problematic annotations for each of the derived genomes.

On February 28th at 3pm EST we will provide a webinar demonstrates this service. Please email rwattam@vt.edu if you plan to attend so that we will know approximately how many participants to expect. The webinar will be recorded and made available for later access.
