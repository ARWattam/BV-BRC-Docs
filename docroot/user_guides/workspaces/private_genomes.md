# Private Genomes

## Overview
PATRIC allows users to have their own private genomes stored in the workspace and also available integrated with the rest of the PATRIC public genome data to enable comparative analysis.

## Creating Private Genomes on the PATRIC Website
A private genome is automatically created as a result of running the Genome Annotation Service. See the [Genome Annotation Service User Guide](https://docs.patricbrc.org//user_guides/services/genome_annotation_service.html) for details.

## Accessing and Using Private Genomes in the PATRIC Website
Upon successful completion of an annotation job, the resulting annotated genome is integrated into the other genome data in PATRIC, but is only viewable by the owner (submitter) of the annotation job. This integration allows use of all the PATRIC genome display and analysis tools, including comparisons with other genomes in PATRIC.

All private genomes can be accessed together by clicking the My Genomes option from the Workspaces top menu item.

This will display the Genomes Tab with a table containing all of the user's private genomes.

## Genome Sharing
It is possible to share a genome annoted using the PATRIC Genome Annotation Service with specified other registered users. This allows these other users to interact with the genome in the PATRIC system in the same way as the user who originally annotated the genome.



## Sharing Genomes on the PATRIC website

When logged in, clicking on the "My Genomes" option in the Workspaces top menu displays the list of genomes that have been annotated using the Genome Annotation Service.

Selecting one or more of the genomes in the table enables the "Share" button in the vertical green Action Bar on the right side of the table.

Clicking the Share button opens a dialog box for selecting other users with whom to share the genome.
