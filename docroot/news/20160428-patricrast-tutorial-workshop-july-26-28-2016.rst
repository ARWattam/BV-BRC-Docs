The PATRIC/RAST teams will be offering a tutorial on July 26-28, 2016 at
Argonne National Laboratory in the suburbs of Chicago, IL. The workshop
will run for three days with the third day optional and devoted solely
to participants working on their own problems with help from the
PATRIC/RAST team members. The tutorial will show participants how to
assemble a genome from reads, annotate that genome, and then compare
that genome to the public genomes available in PATRIC using a suite of
comparative analysis tools.  In addition, participants will be able to
construct a metabolic model for their genome, load and analyze RNA-Seq
data, and identify and annotate sequence variation using PATRIC’s new
variation analysis service.
