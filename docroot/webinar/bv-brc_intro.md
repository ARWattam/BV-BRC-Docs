# Introduction to BV-BRC Webinar Series

As part of the launch of the new BV-BRC Beta website, we are offering a webinar series to help new users, as well as PATRIC and IRD/ViPR users, become acquainted with the new website. The first set of webinars will be focused on introduction to the site. We will have follow-on webinars that dive more deeply into functionality and analysis tools. We can also respond to user requests for webinars focused on particular aspects of the website. Webinars will be recorded for reference at later times.
