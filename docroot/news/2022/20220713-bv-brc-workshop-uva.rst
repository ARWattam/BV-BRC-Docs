The BV-BRC (Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center) team will be offering a 3-day **Bioinformatics Workshop on August 30 - September 1, 2022, at the University of Virgnia** in Charlottesville, VA. The workshop will be held at the UVA North Fork Discovery Park, approximately 10 miles north of UVA grounds.  The workshop will show researchers how to use the new BV-BRC website, which is a merger of the two long running bacterial and viral BRC resources, PATRIC and IRD/ViPR, respectively. The workshop will consist of interactive hands-on training sessions. During the first two days, participants will learn how to search for public datasets of interest and perform genomic, comparative genomic, metagenomic, and transcriptomic analysis using various analysis services and tools at BV-BRC. The third day of the workshop will focus on using command-line interface for programmatic search and retrieval of the data and job submissions, as well as users working with their own data and analysis problems with the help from the BV-BRC team members.
