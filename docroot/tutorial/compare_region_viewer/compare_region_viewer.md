# Compare Region Viewer

The Compare Region Viewer was designed to show the genomic neighborhood of a protein-coding gene across a phylogenetic distance. Along with the ability to view the genes in a particular region and filter on reference, representative or all public genomes in the resource, this viewer also enables selecting the number of regions, size, and type of protein family[1, 2].

## Finding, viewing and manipulating the Compare Region Viewer
