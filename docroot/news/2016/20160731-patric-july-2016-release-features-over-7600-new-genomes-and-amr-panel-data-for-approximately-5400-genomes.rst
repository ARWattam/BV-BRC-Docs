**New genomes:** In this release, we have added 7,683 new genomes,
bringing the total number of genomes in PATRIC to over 77,000. 5,483 of
the new genomes are from published AMR studies and were assembled from
the reads available in NCBI SRA database. The remaining 2200 genomes
were added from NCBI GenBank.  The full list of available bacterial
genomes can be accessed from the \ `Genomes Tab for all
bacteria <https://www.patricbrc.org/view/Taxonomy/2#view_tab=genomes>`__,
and from the \ `Genomes Data Landing
Page <https://www.patricbrc.org/view/DataType/Genomes>`__.

**AMR Panel Data:** This release also includes AMR panel data curated
from publications for 5442 genomes. The AMR panel data is displayed on
the corresponding genome overview pages. All available AMR panel data
can be downloaded from
`here <ftp://ftp.patricbrc.org/patric2/current_release/RELEASE_NOTES/PATRIC_genomes_AMR.xlsx>`__.
Additional manual curatuion was performed to clean up all AMR panel data
collected so far for consistency and accuracy.

**AMR Gene Annotations:** PATRIC has undertaken an antimicrobial
resistance (AMR) curation effort with the goal of providing PATRIC users
with the ability to rapidly recognize and project known AMR related
genome features to new genomes in an automated fashion and to use
comparative genomics approaches for the discovery of new resistance
mechanisms. Curation thus far has focused on encoding the following
mechanisms of drug resistance: outer membrane porins, multidrug efflux
mechanisms, and capsular and extracellular polysaccharides. To date, we
have encoded 25 subsystems covering 265 unique functional roles (protein
families). Additional information and curated data are
available \ `here <http://docs.patricbrc.org/news/2016/20160331-patric-antimicrobial-resistance-amr-gene-curation.html>`__\ .
In addition, we thee curated AMR gene functions have been consistently
projected to more than 1.6M genes from all public bacterial genomes
currently available in PATRIC. Projected AMR gene annotations are
available `here. <ftp://ftp.patricbrc.org/patric2/patric_amr_genes/>`__

**New Alpha Version of Website:** We have also released an Alpha Version
of the new PATRIC website design that is built on a new software
platform to enhance flexibility and efficiency in software development.
It also streamlines workflows and makes the website navigation and
interactions more consistent throughout.

*Note: The Alpha version is intended for testing and evaluation only. If
you would like to participate in testing the Alpha system, please send
an email to help@patricbrc.org and include the phrase “Alpha Testing” in
the title of the email.*
