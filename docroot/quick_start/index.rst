BV-BRC Quick Start
==================

The Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center (BV-BRC) is an information system designed to support research on bacterial and viral infectious diseases. BV-BRC combines two long-running BRCs: `PATRIC <https://www.patricbrc.org/>`_, the bacterial system, and `IRD <https://www.fludb.org/brc/home.spg?decorator=influenza>`_/`ViPR <https://www.viprbrc.org/brc/home.spg?decorator=vipr>`_, the viral systems. The following introductory documentation is designed to help orient users of these legacy systems, as well as new users, to the combined BV-BRC.
