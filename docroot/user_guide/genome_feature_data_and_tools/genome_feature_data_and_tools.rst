Genome Feature Data and Tools
==================================

PATRIC genome features are the resulting annotations from the RASTtk
system, and include coding sequences (CDS / gene calls), protein
function predictions, rRNAs, tRNAs, and specialty gene designations. An
array of various comparative tools are available in PATRIC for working
with genome features and their products.
