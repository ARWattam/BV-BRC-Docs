# Compare Region Viewer

The Compare Region Viewer was designed to show the genomic neighborhood of a protein-coding gene across a phylogenetic distance. Along with the ability to view the genes in a particular region and filter on reference, representative or all public genomes in the resource, this viewer also enables selecting the number of regions, size, and type of protein family[1, 2].

## Finding, viewing and manipulating the Compare Region Viewer
1.	From any protein encoding gene landing page, click on the **Compare Region Viewer** tab.

2.	This will open the tab that shows the neighborhood surrounding the gene of interest, which is a red arrow.  The default view shows the cross-genus protein families (PGFams[3]) in a region of 10,000 bp across 10 of the [RefSeq Reference and Representative genomes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/about/prokaryotes/).  The 10 genomes shown are selected based on the strength of the BLAST[4] hit for the selected gene, which is depicted in red.
