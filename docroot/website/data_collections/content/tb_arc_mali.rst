It is estimated that one third of the worldâ€™s population is infected with Mycobacterium  tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), causing 8.7 million new cases and 1.4 million deaths each year (World Health Organization, 2012). Mali has an incidence of 62 cases per 100,000 people, with an estimated 140 cases of MDR-TB (World Health Organization, 2012).

Through a collaboration with SEREFO, a research center affiliated with the University of Bamako, we have a collection of 93 clinical isolates from patients from Bamako, Mali. These isolates come from two clinical trials conducted by SEREFO, and include a mix of new cases and cases where the treatment failed. From these isolates, we selected all of the MDR isolates as well as non-MDR isolates that most closely matched each MDR isolate in terms of spoligotype and patient history. In addition, we selected all of the non-M. tuberculosis strains available, which included a number of M. africanum strains, and one M. bovis BCG.

One major goal in performing whole genome sequencing of these clinical isolates is to further our understanding of drug resistance in TB by determining whether there are any mutations, including new mutations, outside of the classical resistance mutations that correlate with drug resistance. The fact that this collection contains a number of different TB lineages will help ensure that findings are true across a range of genetic backgrounds. Furthermore, the spoligotyping data indicates that these M. tuberculosis isolates are not clonal populations that originated from a single patient, thus we expect to see a variety of mutations in these isolates.

This collection is also unique due to the large number of isolates of M. africanum, a close relative of M. tuberculosis that causes a disease that clinically is very similar to M. tuberculosis, but is generally only found in West African patients. Another major goal of this project is to explore the genome structure of M. africanum and how it compares to M. tuberculosis. Increasing the number of M. africanum genomes available could provide a number of valuable insights into this organism, and may even help explain why it has such a limited host range compared to M. tuberculosis. Similarities between M. africanum and M. tuberculosis could help identify critical genes to mycobacterial pathogenesis, which could serve as novel drug targets.
