**Additional Special Data Sets**
================================

In addition to incorporating large data sets from public repositories,
PATRIC features Special Collections data pages that highlight data sets
that were generated for users to use together to study a problem. Many
of the collections have been generated by NIAID-funded projects to
provide baseline data for further use by researchers. Where available,
we include the results of the analysis across the collection of data.
The following special data sets have been added or updated in this
release:

-  `Clinical Proteomics
   Centers <http://enews.patricbrc.org/niaid-clinical-proteomics/>`__:
   MS/MS and MRM data for the Caprion “Diagnostic & treatment response
   biomarkers of brucellosis,” “Discovery of serum protein biomarkers of
   Active Tuberculosis in HIV- and HIV+ Individuals,” and Biomarkers of
   TB Disease Progression projects”; Experimental data from the UTMB
   “Biomarkers of *Helicobacter pylori* associated peptic ulcer disease”
   project
-  Driving Biological Projects: RNA-Seq and ChIP-seq data sets for the
   “`Identification of *Salmonella*-specific Regulatory
   Networks <http://enews.patricbrc.org/patric-dbps/#DBP4>`__” project
