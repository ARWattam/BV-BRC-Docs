`TB-ARC Belarus at Broad <https://olive.broadinstitute.org/projects/tb_belarussia>`_

TB samples collected at The Republican Research and Practical Center for Pulmonology and Tuberculosis (RRPCPTB) based in Minsk, Belarus have been sequenced with the following goals:

1. To further investigate differences between genomes of TB strains with varied virulence, clinical manifestation of disease, and resistance to drugs;
2. Reveal phylogenetic and phylogeographic peculiarities of Mtb strains in Belarus;
3. Perform comparative analysis of MDR- and XDR-TB strains from Belarus with strains of M. tuberculosis H37Rv, M. tuberculosis CDC1551 and strains from other countries;
4. Add to the existing body of information and knowledge to promote research resulting in creating a new generation of TB drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics.
