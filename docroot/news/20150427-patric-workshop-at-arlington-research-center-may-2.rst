PATRIC will host a workshop for high school and community college
educators at the Virginia Tech Research Center in Arlington, VA, from
9am-5pm on Saturday, May 2, 2015. The workshop is free, but registration
is required. Participants will also need to bring a laptop. To register,
please visit the workshop

Throughout the day, workshop sessions focusing on computational biology
will help educators find ways to connect science with the daily lives of
students. All of the sessions will provide real-life examples that will
be applicable to classroom situations:

1. The first session will use *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, a common and
   occasionally deadly bacteria, to explore evolutionary principles of
   antibiotic resistance, how PATRIC operates and how educators can make
   use of its database.

2. The second session will focus on comparative genomics, using the 2011
   European outbreak of *Escherichia coli* as a model. Different tools
   from PATRIC will be used to explore the variation in families of
   bacteria as well as differences in pathogenicity and antibiotic
   resistance.

3. The final sessions will focus on exploring biochemistry using
   metabolic pathways and genomes and gene expression. Using PATRIC’s
   Comparative Pathway Tool, educators will be able to see how pathogens
   living within and outside of host cells have different metabolic
   properties. In the gene expression workshop, participants will trace
   how *Yersinia pestis*, the organism responsible for bubonic plague,
   is affected by temperature.
