New Genomes
===========

In this release, we have added 4653 new genomes, including replacement
of 3200 *Streptococcus* genomes which had issues with the sequence data.
This update brings the total number of genomes in PATRIC to over 79,000.
The full list of available bacterial genomes can be accessed from
the \ `Genomes Tab for all
bacteria <https://www.patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/GenomeList?cType=taxon&cId=2&dataSource=&displayMode=&pk=&kw=>`__,
and from the \ `Genomes Data Landing
Page <https://www.patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/Genomes>`__.

Literature References from SEED
===============================

We have added approximately 8000 literature references from the SEED
system as structured assertions for genes, mapped to over 8 million
genes in PATRIC. An example can be seen
`here <https://www.patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/Feature?cType=feature&cId=PATRIC.83332.12.NC_000962.CDS.226878.230462.fwd>`__.
(Scroll to the bottom of the gene page and look in the Comments table. 
The row with “SEED” as the Source has a direct link to the literature
reference in PubMed.)

Assembly Service Enhancements
=============================

This release includes enhancements to the Assembly Service that support
reference-based quality evaluation and hybrid PacBio/Illumina
assemblies. The PATRIC Genome Assembly Service is available
`here <https://www.patricbrc.org/app/Assembly>`__.
