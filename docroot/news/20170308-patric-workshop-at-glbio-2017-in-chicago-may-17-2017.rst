PATRIC will be hosting a 1/2-day workshop entitled “Assemble, Annotate
and Analyze Your Own Genome using PATRIC, the All Bacterial
Bioinformatics Resource Center,” at the Great Lakes Bioinformatics
(GLBIO) Conference at the University of Illinois at Chicago on May 17,
2017 in Chicago, Illinois.  The workshop will cover PATRIC’s analysis
pipelines, which include genome assembly and annotation, and tools for
