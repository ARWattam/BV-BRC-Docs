Bovine tuberculosis is a zoonosis that is associated with devastating consequences to agriculture and public health. Zoonotic tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium bovis, threatens the US populace from two majors directions. First, in the US we have a wildlife reservoir of bovine tuberculosis, which has meant an alarming increase in the incidence of tuberculosis in cattle in recent years. Second, zoonotic tuberculosis is a major concern in rural areas of the developing world, where the animal-human interface is intensifying as land use patterns change. Global trade agreements have resulted in the importation of animals infected with tuberculosis into the US.

The severe and growing threat of M. bovis necessitates rapid, thorough national and international surveillance of strain distribution dynamics in the population. To date, piecemeal analysis of M. bovis genomes and conventional genotyping methods have not lead to a comprehensive resolution of its genetic diversity to explain the wide range of disease phenotypes caused by this zoonotic pathogen. Conventional genotyping methods target a small hypervariable region on the genome of M. bovis and provide anonymous biallelic information insufficient to develop M. bovis phylogeny. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) studies in M. tuberculosis have shown to have sufficient resolution to develop trait-allele associations. We hypothesize that genetic and phenotypic diversity in M. bovis is enciphered in their genomes. Toward this end, we have assembled 8 strains from global sources (countries of South America, Africa, and Asia) for genome sequencing and developing a population genetic structure of M. bovis.

It has been recently proposed that a greater knowledge of the evolutionary history of M. tuberculosis could yield advances in producing lineage- or region specific diagnostics and / or vaccines. It is feasible therefore that a greater understanding of the evolutionary history of M. bovis could also yield similar insights. We request the microbial genomics resource to sequence the 8 strains in our collection to help begin the development of phylogeography of this apparently conserved organism.
