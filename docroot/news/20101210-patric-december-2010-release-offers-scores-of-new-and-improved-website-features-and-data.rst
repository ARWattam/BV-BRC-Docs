**Website Enhancements**
========================

**New Virulence and Disease Information**
-----------------------------------------

Information related to virulence, disease and outbreaks is now available
through a new PATRIC tab at all taxonomy levels.

-  Shows relationship between pathogens, diseases, virulence factors,
   and host genes.
-  Represents data in tables, as well as, in a graph visualization.
-  Includes global disease reports (e.g., incidents and other) in an
   interactive map as provided in collaboration with Health Map.

For an example, see
http://patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/DiseaseOverview?cType=taxon&cId=1763

**New Phylogenetic/Species Tree Viewer**
----------------------------------------

We have updated all PATRIC phylogenetic trees to include latest
genomes.  These are accessed via a our new interactive, multicolor tree
viewer which show large trees and phylogenetic relationships more
efficiently and effectively than traditional coloring schemes.

For an example, see
http://patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/Phylogeny?cType=taxon&cId=356

**Improved Protein Family Sorter**
----------------------------------

The Protein Family Sorter (PFS) is now available as a tab from taxonomy
pages at genus level and below.  PFS now includes:

-  PATRIC’s Protein Family Sorter allows users to search and filter on
   FIGfams and now provides improved coverage (as compared to previous
   releases) of proteins in PATRIC.
-  New interactive heatmap visualization that allows users to visually
   sift through large numbers of protein families based on their
   presence or absence in the genomes of interest. Users can select
   collections of proteins (from genomes and/or protein families of
   interest) from the heatmap and download related data in multiple
   formats.  For an example, see
   http://test.patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/FIGfamSorterB?cType=taxon&cId=1392&dm=result#gs_0=-1638842268.
-  New interactive multiple sequence alignment (MSA) for protein
   families.   More information on MSA is described below.

For an example, see
http://patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/FIGfamSorter?cType=taxon&cId=234&dm=result

**Protein Structure Viewer**
----------------------------

To support exploration of protein structures, PATRIC now boasts an
interactive JMOL-based viewer that displays 3D protein structures
(accessible via the ‘Experiment Data’ tab at all taxon levels). 
Features, such as ligands, chains, and secondary structure annotations,
can be dynamically displayed directly on these structures using
interactive controls.

For an example of a structure list, see
http://patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/Structure?cType=taxon&cId=234&filter=ssgcid#key=1747&pS=20&aP=1

For an example of our 3D viewer, see
http://patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/Jmol?structureID=3P0X

**Integration with BEIResources and Structural Genomics Centers**
-----------------------------------------------------------------

We now offer direct links from specific PATRIC structures to clone sets
available from Biodefense & Emerging Infections Research Resources
Repository (BEIRRR).  Specifically, PATRIC links to BEIRRR clones which
were submitted by the Seattle Structural Genomics Center for Infectious
Disease (`SSGCID <http://www.ssgcid.org/>`__) and the Center for
Structural Genomics of Infectious Diseases
(`CSGID <http://www.csgid.org/>`__).  These links are available from
appropriate feature and structure pages.

**New Interactive Multiple Sequence Alignment Viewer Now Available from Protein Family Sorter**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PATRIC’s new multiple sequence alignment (MSA) viewer displays MSA and
family tree side-by-side and allows users to collapse/expand tree
branches in order to co-locate sequences of interest.  The MSA viewer
also allows interactive coloring of amino acids in the MSA based on
conservation per position.

--------------

**Enhanced Genome Selector in all Searches and Tools**
------------------------------------------------------

Many of PATRIC’s searches and tools allow users to select specific
orders, species, etc. in order to scope their search accordingly.  To
improve the selection process across all of these searches and tools,
PATRIC now provides an improved genome selection panel that allows
on-the-fly, in-line search to quickly find taxonomy nodes or genomes of
interest.  Searching and selecting is supported in the (previously
released) taxonomy tree structure, as well as, the new alphabetized
list.

For an example of the enhanced genome selector, see
`http://patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/GenomeFinder?cType=taxon&cId=&dm= <http://patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/GenomeFinder?cType=taxon&cId=&dm>`__

**Improved Toolbar for All PATRIC Tables**
------------------------------------------

Every table in PATRIC (e.g., feature tables, search result tables,
tables of protein families), now sport an Improved toolbar design with
intuitive icons and grouping of related actions.   These new table
toolbars allow users to select items in the table and perform various
actions on them, such as view sequence data, download data, send
selected features to analysis tools (e.g., MSA), and so on.

For an example, see
http://patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/FeatureTable?cType=taxon&cId=234

**PATRIC Group Explorer**
-------------------------

Throughout the site, users can create custom ad-hoc groups of features
using PATRIC’s ‘Add to Cart’ button on any table’s control bar.  Once
groups have been created, users can employ the Group Explorer to
compare, contrast and even crate new groups using a Venn diagram-based
interactive visualization.  Users’ can conveniently access the Group
Explorer from the Feature Cart icon at the top of every PATRIC page.

For more information, see the PATRIC `Group Explorer
FAQs <http://enews.patricbrc.org/group-explorer-faqs/>`__.
