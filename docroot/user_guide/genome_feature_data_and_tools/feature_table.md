# Feature Table

## Feature Overview 

Features are defined segments of a genome. Most often features will code
for proteins or RNAs, however some correspond to pseudogenes or repeat
regions. For a complete list of genomic feature types, please see
[PATRICâ€™s Genomic Feature Types](Genomic_Feature_Types).

### Feature Table

Feature tables, located under the Feature Table tab on Organism/Genome
Landing Pages, contain all of the identified features for all of the
genomes in that genus. Tables may be refined to show subsets of features
via various user controls described below.

### Searching for a Specific Genomic Feature, Such as a Protein Coding Sequence

Feature tables have the following filtering and sorting capabilities
that allow for table manipulation and refinement:

-   Filter controls, located at the top of feature tables, allow for
    data filtration via sequence status, feature type, annotation, and
    keyword. For a description of the various types of annotation
    available please see [Genome Annotations](../genome_data_and_tools/genome_annotations.html).


-   By default, tables show 200 rows of data. For rows beyond 200, the
    numbers on the right side below the table, allowing advancement
    throught pages in increments of 200 rows.
-   When a row is selected, the information panel (accessible via the
    Show/Hide icon at the top of the green Action Bar, provides detailed
    information for that row including links to other PATRIC genome
    pages and external resources, such as NCBI protein pages, where
    appropriate. It also provides access to the corresponding nucleotide
    and amino acid sequences.


-   The vertical green Action Bar, located just to the right of the
    feature table provides a set of actions that can be performed on the
    features selected in the table:
    -   Download selected DNA and/or protein sequence data in FASTA
        format. The table itself, or selected data within it, are also
        downloadable in both excel and .txt file formats.
    -   View the selected features in an overview summary or a table
        containing on only those features.
    -   View the genomes associated with the selected feature in an
        overview summary or a table.
    -   View selected DNA and/or protein sequence data in FASTA format.
    -   Create a Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) analysis on selected
        features. For more details see the [Multiple Sequence
        Alignment](Multiple_Sequence_Aligment) user guide.
    -   Utilize the ID Mapping Tool on selected features. For more
        information see [ID Mapping](ID_Mapping) user guide.
    -   View pathways and associated pathway information for your
        selected genes. For more information see the [Comparative
        Pathway](Comparative_Pathway) user guide.
    -   Customize columns shown/hidden in your results table by clicking
        the small '+' symbol in the upper right corner of the table.
        Data may be rearranged by dragging entire columns, adjusting
        individual column width, and sorting by column.

### Filtering

When filtering a feature table based on keyword, PATRIC matches the
user-specified keyword term against the the fields in the table and
shows only those with matching text.

You can also filter by clicking the filter icon above the table on the
right side. It will open a filter panel wherein you can filter on
different columns by value, such as Sequence Type (chromosome, contig,
plasmid) and Topology (linear, circular).
