# Protein Family Sorter

## Overview
The Protein Family Sorter (PFS) allows users to select a set of genomes of interest and examine distribution of the superset of protein families across the genomes, commonly referred to as the “pan genome." The PFS provides various filtering options to quickly locate protein families that are conserved across all the genomes (“core genome”), conserved only in asubset of the selected genomes (“accessory genome”) or that match a specified function. A tabular view shows protein families matching filtering criteria and an interactive heatmap viewer provides a bird’s-eye (“pan genome”) view of the distribution of the protein families across multiple genomes, with clustering andanchoring functions to show relative conservation of synteny and identify areas of possible horizontal transfer.

## Accessing the Protein Family Sorter
The PFS can be accessed by clickging the **Families** icon at the top right of the results page from a Comparative Systems analysis job.
