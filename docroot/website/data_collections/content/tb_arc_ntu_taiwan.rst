Fluoroquinolones (FQs) have been a cornerstone of the treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis, and they are gaining increasing attention as possible components of new first-line chemotherapeutic regimens. A variety of FQs have been used clinically, including gatifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin (OFX), and moxifloxacin, which is currently being evaluated as a first-line therapeutic. Resistance to FQs in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is most frequently due to mutations in the drug target, DNA gyrase. These occur in the quinolone resistance determining regions (QRDRs) of the gyrA and gyrB genes, and the majority of genetically characterized FQR Mtb strains have mutations in these regions, most often in several highly conserved codons. However, in a recent survey of FQ resistant Mtb isolates collected in Taiwan in the years 2004 and 2005, it was observed that while FQ resistance rates were generally low (3%), a sizeable fraction of FQ resistant isolates (9 of 14) had no detectable changes in the QRDR of either gyrA or gyrB. Of the 14 FQ resistant samples, 6 were resistant to another drug, and 4 of these were MDR (Wang, 2007). We now have a panel of well-characterized FQ resistant Mtb strains isolated from patients in Taiwan that do not have mutations in the QRDR of either gyrA or gyrB. We are sequencing the genomes of these strains in an effort to reveal the genetic basis for the FQ resistance of these organisms.

This project is critical for several reasons:

1. FQs are an important drug in the treatment of MDR TB, and it is critical to understand the full set of ways in which resistance develops to this class of drugs.
2. Proper epidemiological tracking of FQ resistance requires a complete understanding of the genetic basis for resistance.
3. The development of new molecular diagnostics hinges on a complete understanding of resistance-associated mutations.
4. The sequencing of these strains will ultimately contribute to the larger effort to define the genetic determinants of multiple drug resistance in Mtb.

We anticipate that sequencing the genomes of these FQ resistant isolates will yield correlations between FQ resistance and polymorphisms in genes other than gyrA and gyrB, the two canonical loci associated with FQ resistance. While these Taiwanese strains will likely contain a large number of polymorphisms relative to any strain used as a reference, we hope to use the sequenced genomes from FQ-sensitive Mtb strains, including a panel of strains from the same geographic region, as a comparator to identify candidate FQ resistance-conferring mutations.

Candidate FQ resistance-conferring mutations will be evaluated genetically by engineering the candidate causative lesions into the genome of a FQ-sensitive laboratory strain using recombineering (van Kessel, 2008), or by plasmid-based expression of the protein encoded by the candidate resistance allele in a sensitive strain. Once these strains are engineered, the contribution of these mutations to FQ resistance will be assessed using standard FQ susceptibility assays.
