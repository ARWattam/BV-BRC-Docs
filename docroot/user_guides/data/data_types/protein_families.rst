Protein Families
================

As Part of Genome Annotation, Proteins are Mapped to Protein Families Called FIGfams

FIGfams enable comparative genomic analysis at PATRIC. They are generated by the Fellowship for Interpretation of Genomes (FIG) and are constructed from careful manual curation of subsystems and automated analysis of closely related strains. FIGfams are based on sequence similarity over the entire protein length, and on the conserved genomic context.

Our `Protein Family Sorter Tool <http://docs.patricbrc.org/user_guides/organisms_taxon/protein_families.html>`_ allows researchers to compare protein families across closely related or diverse groups of genomes, visualize them using an interactive Heatmap, and generate multiple sequence alignments (with phylogenetic trees) for individual families.

**How Do We Process and Clean Up Our Data?**
