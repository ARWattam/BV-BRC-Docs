The assembled genome of Colistin-resistant *E. coli* MRSN 388634 is now
available in PATRIC
`here <https://www.patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/Genome?cType=genome&cId=562.10576>`__.
Sequence reads for MRSN388634 have been deposited in the NCBI Short Read
Archive by researchers at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and
Walter Reed National Military Medical Center under Accession number
SRP075674. The authors report the presence of mcr-1 in an *E. coli*
cultured from a patient with a urinary tract infection in the United
States. The early version of the publication can be found at
“http://aac.asm.org/content/early/2016/05/25/AAC.01103-16.full.pdf”. A
provisional assembly and annotation is provided in PATRIC using the
PATRIC Genome Assembly and Genome Annotation services and can be
accessed
`here <https://www.patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/Genome?cType=genome&cId=562.10576>`__.
We will provide the GenBank version of the assembly once the genome
becomes available in GenBank. We would like to thank the members of the
Walter Reed team for their early release of the data in the Short Read
Archive.
