In September 2009, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
awarded a five-year contract to Virginia Tech’s CyberInfrastructure
Group (CIG) to support the biomedical research community’s work on
infectious diseases. The funding is being used to develop a
multi-faceted web-based bioinformatics resource that provides rich data
and analysis tools for all bacterial species with an emphasis on the
bacterial Orders that include NIAID category A-C priority pathogens.

December 9, 2009 marks our initial release of the PATRIC Website. By
design, this release is data-centric, providing the first compiled set
of all bacterial genomes, along with their annotations, available from
RefSeq and GFF3 files provided by incumbent BRCs from the previous BRC
awards. The following table summarizes the data loaded in the PATRIC
database and currently available through this December 9, 2009 PATRIC
Website release. At this time, we are missing data from a small number
of GFF3 files, but are working to make these data available by December
31, 2009.

This December 9, 2009 PATRIC website release provides the following
functionality:

   </p>

.. raw:: html

   <ul>

.. raw:: html

   <li>

Basic Website Navigation: Including Taxonomy Browser, Taxon Overview
page, Genome Overview page, Genome/Sequence List, Genomic Feature Table,
and Feature Overview page.

.. raw:: html

   </li>

.. raw:: html

   <li>

Searches and Tools: Genome Finder and Feature Search Tools allow users
to quickly find genomes or features of interest. BLAST Search allows
users to quickly search genomic sequences and protein coding genes based
on sequence similarity.

.. raw:: html

   </li>

.. raw:: html

   <li>

Feature Cart: Allows users to collect the features of interest from
multiple pages across the PATRIC website. Once collected, these features
can be exported as FASTA DNA or FASTA Protein sequences, or as a Feature
Table.

.. raw:: html

   </li>

.. raw:: html

   <li>

PubMed Integration: A simple but effective real-time literature
retrieval system that quickly identifies publications relevant to a
taxon, genome, or gene of interest using PubMed and Entrez Programming
Utilities (eUtils) from NCBI and search terms derived from genome
metadata and/or functional annotation of a gene/protein. Users can
filter results by area of interest (i.e., Countermeasures, Diagnosis,
Disease, Epidemiology, or Gene Expression).

.. raw:: html

   </li>

.. raw:: html

   <li>

Google Search: Provides an automated list of related web resources as
determined by Google search engine; resources are grouped by content
category including Google Web, News, Images, Books, Patents, and Video.
Google search results are summarized on Taxon, Genome, and Fetaure
Overview pages, and direct links are provided to the detailed result
pages.

.. raw:: html

   </li>

.. raw:: html

   <li>

File Download: Allows users to download genome sequences and annotations
as GenBank or GFF3 files.
