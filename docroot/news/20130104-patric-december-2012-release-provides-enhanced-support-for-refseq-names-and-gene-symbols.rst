This release provides several changes that should make it much easier
for researchers to find their genes and proteins of interest using
several alternate names.  The most visible change is a new feature
overview page that contains consolidated information for genes, CDS, and
proteins, and provides more prominent presentation of alternate names.  
The enhancements are also seen in improved global search results, and in
tables and names across the site.   This consolidation has also provided
for better PubMed search results at the feature level.

We have provided links to additional external resources such as STRING,
STITCH, and NCBI’s CDD, as well as facilitating literature searches in
PubMed Central and Google Scholar.  In addition, there are other minor
enhancements such as improvements to ID mapping services.
