`TB-ARC Romania at Broad <https://olive.broadinstitute.org/projects/tb_romania>`_

Despite the continuous decline of tuberculosis in Romania since year 2004, the case notification rate remained the highest in the European Union countries, with 79.4 cases per 100,000 population (16,992 new, and retreatment cases). In the drug resistance survey organized in Romania in 2003-2004, the proportion of MDR-TB was 2.9% among new, and 10.7% among previously treated cases, respectively. The first drug resistance survey for second line drugs among MDR-TB cases organized in 2009-2010, shows 9.6%, and 11.6% XDR-TB among new and previously treated cases, respectively.

The spoligotyping analysis of 197 clinical isolates of drug resistant strains of M.tuberculosis collected from 14 counties from Central and North-Western part of Romania shows that 179 (90.9%) from all the strains have a shared international type number. They are grouped into 11 clusters, the biggest one containing alone 56 strains. The studied strains were identified as belonging to the next families: Haarlem1 (56/197, 28.4%), T1 (30/197, 15.2%) T2 (23/197, 11.7%), S (16/197, 8.1%), Haarlem 3 and Haarlem 4-each (15/197, 7.6%), T3 (13/197, 6.6%). An amount of 18 (9.1%) isolates are not identified in SpolDB4 database. Strain families are uniformly distributed in the 14 counties. No Beijing family strain was found among these strains.

In a comparative assessment of M. tuberculosis resistance pattern obtained in absolute concentration method and in GenoType (HAIN) assay, rpoB region was affected in 142 out of 151 rifampicin resistant strains (94,7%); in 212 isoniazid resistant strains, katG gene was involved in 180 strains (84,9%), and inhA gene in 38 strains (17,9%).

In addition to the characteristics of M. tuberculosis strains which can be obtained by using the above mentioned methods, DNA sequencing methods facilitate the estimation of mutation rate from different lineages and could predict differences in the emergence of drug resistant tuberculosis.

The aims of this study is to have a full description of the genetic support of drug resistant M. tuberculosis strains circulating in Romania and estimate the genetic diversity of this strains.
