     p3-genus-species.pl [options]


This script produces a two-column table listing each genus/species pair in the BV-BRC database along with how many genomes in each.
Pseudo-species (those that are numbers, or begin with \ ``sp.``\ ) are not included. Candidatus genera are also skipped. The idea is to
produce an orthodox list suitable for an exhaustive species-by-species analysis of some sort.
