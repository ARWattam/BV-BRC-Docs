# Subsystems Data


## Overview
The Subsystems Data page includes a distribution pie chart that summarizes the functionality and genes across all genomes selected. It also includes a table showing the individual subsystems available. When a subsystem is selected, a heatmap can be displayed showing the genes that are included in it and the presence and absence of those genes across all the genomes in the selection.
