# Surveillance Data

## Overview
Data from worldwide influenza surveillance studies, including both avian and non-human mammalian samples, have been collected by the NIAID-funded Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Surveillance ([CEIRS](https://www.niaidceirs.org/)) program and deposited into the IRD and the BV-BRC.  Surveillance records can be queried using various criteria including: whether the sample was positive or negative for influenza, geographic location, and/or avian taxonomy classification. BV-BRC uses [Avibase](https://avibase.bsc-eoc.org/avibase.jsp?lang=EN) as the standard for taxonomy, and scientific and common names of avian host species. 

Human samples were collected from patients presenting at a physician with influenza symptoms. Samples were collected from all patients and virus was isolated and sequenced from flu positive samples. Associated clinical data may also be available as part of the search results.

## Accessing Surveillance data

Surveillance data can be accessed through multiple routes in BV-BRC: 

1\. Specifically searching for protein structure data by selecting "Surveillance" as the data type from the Global Search bar.

![Figure 1](../images/surveillance_Picture1.png "Figure 1")

2\. Using the advanced search for Surveillance (red arrow) under the “SEARCHES” menu. 

![Figure 2](../images/surveillance_Picture2.png "Figure 2")

3\. Selecting “Surveillance” as the data type (red arrow) after performing a quick search for all data types. 

![Figure 3](../images/surveillance_Picture3.png "Figure 3")

4\. Selecting the “Surveillance” tab when browsing data for a specific virus.

## Surveillance List View and Column Definitions

Surveillance data is listed in tabular format in the BV-BRC as shown below. 

![Figure 5](../images/surveillance_Picture5.png "Figure 5")

Several metadata fields are available for surveillance results including those associated with animal surveillance or human clinical data associated with human samples. Visible metadata columns can be customized by clicking on the “+” sign at the top right corner of the table, as shown below.
