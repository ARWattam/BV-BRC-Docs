The BV-BRC team will be offering a Bioinformatics Workshop on July 19-21, 2022, at Argonne National Laboratory in the suburbs of Chicago, IL. The workshop will show researchers how to use the new BV-BRC website, which is a merger of the two long running bacterial and viral BRC resources, PATRIC and IRD/ViPR, respectively. The workshop will consist of interactive hands-on training sessions, during which researchers will learn how to search for public datasets of interest and perform genomic, comparative genomic, metagenomic, and transcriptomic analysis using various analysis services and tools at BV-BRC. The workshop will have interactive hand-on training sessions, with third day devoted to users working with their own data and analysis problems with the help from the BV-BRC team members.

The workshop will be limited to 40 people on a first-come, first-served basis. There is no fee for the workshop, but participants are responsible for their own travel expenses, accommodation, and meals. 

If you wish to participate, please fill out the “Argonne Visitor Request” form at: https://apps.anl.gov/registration/visitors as soon as possible — especially non-U.S. Citizens, since they will take additional time to be cleared. Please enter Lisa Hundley, lhundley@anl.gov, for the “Sponsor’s E-mail Address.”

After you have completed registration, please send a mail to Lisa Hundley ( lhundley@anl.gov ) to confirm your registration.

**Note:** Please note the COVID-19 restrictions and safety guidance currently in place at the Argonne National Laboratory.
* All visitors must be fully vaccinated or provide accepted proof of negative COVID-19 test results that are less than 72 hours old. 
* Face coverings are required, except to the extent necessary to eat or drink when maintaining appropriate physical distance, or when an individual is isolated in an enclosed space.
* We will keep the desks at least 6 feet apart from each other at the workshop venue to maintain safe physical distance.   
* There are outdoor seating areas with gazebos, which can be used during breaks and lunch time. Face coverings may be removed while outside and socially distancing.
