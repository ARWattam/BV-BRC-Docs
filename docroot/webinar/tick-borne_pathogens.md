 # Ticks and Tick-Borne Pathogens Webinar Series

In collaboration with our sister BRC, [VEuPathDB](https://veupathdb.org/veupathdb/app/) (Eukaryotic Pathogen, Vector and Host Informatics Resource), we are offering this webinar series geared towards researchers working on ticks and the bacterial, viral or eukaryotic pathogens they transmit. The webinars will focus on highlighting data and bioinformatic tools provided by the NIAID bioinformatic resource centers, BV-BRC and VEuPathDB.

In addition, we welcome open discussion during the webinars so we can learn about your research needs the the BRCs might be able to provide. The webinars occur every other Tuesday from March 8 - June 14. Details including registration information are available at the VEuPathDB website from the link below.
