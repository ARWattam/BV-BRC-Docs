The emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) has complicated global TB control efforts. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that up to half a million multidrug-resistant TB cases occur annually. (World Health Organization, 2013)

Recognizing the untapped potential of applying genomic techniques to advance understanding and improve care for drug resistant tuberculosis, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) generously sponsored a Tuberculosis Resistance Collaboration between the KwaZulu-Natal Research Institute for Tuberculosis and HIV (K-RITH) and the Broad Institute. This collaborative sequencing project was formed to close the gap on critical deficiencies in data for the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome with emphasis upon MDR-TB, XDR-TB, and TDR-TB strains. The goal for this work is to obtain full genome sequence data from well characterized DR, MDR, XDR, and TDR TB strains to understand the genomic patterns of drug resistance in support of (1) predictive analytics platforms and services to support patient treatment, (2) development of new diagnostics, (3) new drug-target discovery and (4) molecular epidemiology for population control programs including drug supply chain management.
Goals

1. Identifying Additional Mechanisms of Drug Resistance: seeking genotypically susceptible, yet phenotypically resistant isolates.
2. Assessing within Patient Genetic Diversity of M. tuberculosis in patients initiating Treatment for Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis.
3. Understanding the Molecular Mechanisms of Clofazimine and other XDR-TB drugs.
4. Characterizing Pre-XDR Strains
5. Characterizing Additional Drug Susceptible Strains of Appropriate Phylogenetic Lineages
