PATRIC May 2012 Release Introduces New Homepage, Workflow Pages, over 1200 New Genomes and More
===============================================================================================

**Website Enhancements**
========================

This release includes several completely redesigned areas of the PATRIC
website, including a new homepage, several workflow pages, a
consolidated tool landing page, and improved look and feel site-wide to
enhance the PATRIC’s general usability.

**Homepage**

Working with representative users of the PATRIC community, our new
homepage design philosophy promotes critical PATRIC tools, data pages
and analysis capabilities.  The new homepage now includes:

-  A large amount of screen real-estate dedicated to showcasing explicit
   biologically-relevant workflows that illustrate how users can
   accomplish important tasks using PATRIC.  These workflows will be
   updated over time and are framed around interesting research
   questions in life-science.
-  Direct access to PATRIC’s BLAST interface.  This visually lightweight
   interface component allows users to copy-and-paste a nucleotide or
   amino acid sequence and BLAST against all PATRIC data with one
   click.  Access to advanced BLAST options is available from this
   interface as well.
-  A visual-mosaic of a subset of PATRIC’s most powerful tools.  Each
   tool is summarized in a few sentences and is accompanied by a
   thumbnail graphic.  At a glance, users can immediately see the
   breadth of tools PATRIC offers and can access a given tool of
   interest in just one click.
-  A revamped tag cloud depicting the most recently-accessed bacterial
   genomes at PATRIC as measured using live Google Analytics website
   traffic statistics.

**Workflow Pages**

PATRIC’s new workflow pages allow users to get a quick understanding of
how to use a handful of  PATRIC pages and tools within the context of a
biologically-relevant question.  We’ve purposely structured these
workflow pages to appeal to biologists who may have similar research
interests but are not aware of how best to leverage PATRIC to make their
work easier.  We will be adding new workflow pages on a regular basis as
we grow PATRIC’s suite of data and capabilities.  For this release we
provide workflows describing how users may:

-  `Find genomic islands in emergent *E. coli*
   strains, <http://www.patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/Workflow?page=new-e-coli-strain-virulence-analysis-via-genomic-island>`__
-  `Identify proteins from recent outbreaks in
   Europe <http://www.patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/Workflow?page=collect-2011-e-coli-outbreak-shiga-toxins>`__,
   and
-  `Compare pathways across diverse *Mycobacterium*
   species. <http://www.patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/Workflow?page=tb-comparative-pathways-wf>`__

Each workflow includes detailed PATRIC screen images and instructive
text in enough detail so that users can conduct similar workflows with
data relevant to their datasets and/or interests.  Lastly, each workflow
contains a number of links to other areas within PATRIC related to
either tools and/or data pages illustrated in the workflow.

**Tool Landing Page**

With the number of PATRIC tools growing with each release, we now offer
the PATRIC `Tool Landing
Page <http://www.patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/Tools>`__; a
one-stop shop showcasing all of PATRIC’s tools categorized into four
broad areas:  specialized searches, comparative analyses, annotation
pipelines, and visual browsers.  In this release, the tool landing page
offers quick summary and direct access to 17 tools. We have also updated
PATRIC’s main navigation bar under “Searches & Tools” to reflect the
full set of tools and categories.

**Updated and Improved Look and Feel**

We have updated PATRIC’s fonts, colors, and graphics to provide greater
readability and visual scanning capabilities.  This allows us to present
data-rich pages that are easy to read and understand. The new formatting
also helps users find the information of interest within a given page
with greater ease.  These improvements also include a streamlined PATRIC
header with improved main navigation, as well as a redesigned footer
where all social networking features are now grouped.

**Genomes and Annotations**
===========================

Since March 2012, \ `1273 new genomes have been added to
PATRIC <http://brcdownloads.vbi.vt.edu/patric2/genomes.May2012/RELEASE_NOTES/genomes_added>`__
and `69 genomes have been
updated <http://brcdownloads.vbi.vt.edu/patric2/genomes.May2012/RELEASE_NOTES/genomes_updated>`__.
Total `1251 new genomes have been annotated using
RAST <http://brcdownloads.vbi.vt.edu/patric2/genomes.May2012/RELEASE_NOTES/new_genomes_annotated>`__.

A summary of the genomes available on the PATRIC website through May,
2012 is provided in the table below:
