PATRIC provides a service that allows researchers to compare annotated proteins by bi-directional BLASTP analysis.  The Proteome Comparison tool can be used to examine up to compare nine genomes to single reference, which can be a genome that has been annotated in PATRIC or from an independent source, or a group of proteins.  On January 30th at 4pm EST we will provide a webinar demonstrates this service. Please email rwattam@vt.edu if you plan to attend so that we will know approximately how many participants to expect. The webinar will be recorded and made available for later access.
