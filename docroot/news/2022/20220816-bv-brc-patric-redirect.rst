  :alt: PATRIC to BV-BRC

We are now in the final phase of transitioning `PATRIC <https://www.patricbrc.org>`_ to the `Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center (BV-BRC) <https://www.bv-brc.org>`_. Website redirects will start in mid-September, and PATRIC will go offline by mid-December of this year. Here is what you need to know.

.. cut::

As `announced previously <../20220215-bv-brc-public-beta.html>`_, `PATRIC <https://www.patricbrc.org>`_, the bacterial BRC, and `IRD <https://www.fludb.org>`_ / `ViPR <https://www.viprbrc.org>`_, the viral BRCs, are being merged into the new `Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center (BV-BRC) <https://www.bv-brc.org>`_. BV-BRC combines the data, tools, and technologies from these BRCs to provide an integrated resource for bacterial and viral genomics-based infectious disease research.

For PATRIC users, the migration will be relatively straightforward bacause BV-BRC is built on the PATRIC platform. This includes the PATRIC private workspace, so all data and analysis service jobs that have been stored and created in PATRIC are available in the BV-BRC workspace. PATRIC users can use the same login credentials in BV-BRC.  

New Features
------------

The new data and features in BV-BRC that are not in PATRIC include the following:

* Viral pathogen data 
   * 8.5M viral genomes
   * SARS-CoV-2 variants and lineages of concern
   * Influenza surveillance and serology data
   * Proteins and protein structures
   * Domains and motifs
   * Epitopes
   * Experiment data
* New analysis tools and services
   * Specialized advanced searches
   * MetaCATS (Metadata-driven Comparative Analysis Tool)
   * Primer Design
   * MSA and SNP Analysis
   * Gene Tree
   * Taxonomic Classification (with support for viral data)
   * Metagenomic Binning (with support for viral data)
   * 3-D Protein Structure Viewer (new)
   * SARS-CoV-2 Genome Assembly and Annotation
