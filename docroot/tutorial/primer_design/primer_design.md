# Primer Design Tutorial

## Overview

The Primer Design Service in the Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center uses the Primer3 tool [1-4] to provide users with the ability to design primers from a given input sequence under a variety of temperature, size, and concentration constraints. Primer3 can be used to design primers for several uses including, PCR primers (PCR = "Polymerase Chain Reaction"), hybridization probes and sequencing primers. 

**Keywords:** Primers, probes, oligo, oligomers, virus, bacteria, phage.
