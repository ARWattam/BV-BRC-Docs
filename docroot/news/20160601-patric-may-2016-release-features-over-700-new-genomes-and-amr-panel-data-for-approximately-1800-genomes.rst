In this release, we have added 748 new genomes from NCBI GenBank,
bringing the total number of genomes in PATRIC to over 70,000. The full
list of available bacterial genomes can be accessed from the `Genomes
Tab for all
bacteria <https://www.patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/GenomeList?cType=taxon&cId=2&dataSource=&displayMode=&pk=&kw=>`__,
and from the `Genomes Data Landing
Page <https://www.patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/Genomes>`__.

This release includes a special genome, corresponding to the first U.S.
case of Colistin-resistant *E. coli* MRSN 388634. Sequence reads for
MRSN388634Â have been deposited in the NCBI Short Read Archive by
researchers at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and Walter
Reed National Military Medical Center under Accession number SRP075674.
The authors report the presence of mcr-1 in an *E. coli* cultured from a
patient with a urinary tract infection in the United States. The early
version of the publication can be found
`here <http://aac.asm.org/content/early/2016/05/25/AAC.01103-16.full.pdf>`__.
A provisional assembly and annotation is provided in PATRIC using the
PATRIC Genome Assembly and Genome Annotation services and can be
accessed
`here <https://www.patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/Genome?cType=genome&cId=562.10576>`__.

This release also includes AMR panel data curated from publications for
1832 genomes. The AMR panel data is displayed on the corresponding
genome overview pages. All available AMR panel data can be downloaded
from
`here <ftp://ftp.patricbrc.org/patric2/current_release/RELEASE_NOTES/PATRIC_genomes_AMR.xlsx>`__.

Finally, we have also added 10 eukaryotic host genomes in PATRIC,
available available
`here <https://www.patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/Taxon?cType=taxon&cId=2759>`__.
These mark our first step in supporting host response data linked to
bacterial infection. After further refinements, these genomes will
provide anchor for the host-pathogen protein-protein interactions and
host response RNA-seq analysis capabilities we plan to provide later
this year.
