# Assembling a genome at PATRIC

There are a variety of programs that can be used to assemble the reads that are produced from 
sequencing machines into contigs or chromosomes, but these can require an advanced 
programming ability that research biologists are sometimes lacking.  To meet this need PATRIC 
allows researchers to assemble short reads that are single or paired (typically from Illumina 
machines), and also long reads from PacBio or Nanopore [1] machines.   PATRIC provides 
several assembly tools and pipelines, the results of which are downloaded into a researcherâ€™s 
private workspace.  Below is the methodology showing the assembly for single reads using the 
default assembly method.
