**Abstract**

Funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the
Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC) is a genomics-centric
relational database and bioinformatics resource designed to assist
scientists in infectious disease research. Specifically, PATRIC provides
scientists with 1. a comprehensive bacterial genomics database, 2. a
plethora of associated data relevant to genomic analysis, and 3. an
extensive suite of computational tools and platforms for bioinformatics
analysis. While the primary focus of PATRIC is to advance the knowledge
underlying the biology of human pathogens, all publicly available
genome-scale data for bacteria are compiled and continually updated,
thereby enabling comparative analyses to reveal the basis for
differences between infectious free-living and commensal species. Herein
we summarize the major features available at PATRIC, dividing the
resources into two major categories: ‘Organisms, Genomes and Comparative
Genomics’ and ‘Recurrent Integration of Community-Derived Associated
Data’. Additionally, we present two experimental designs typical of
bacterial genomics research and execute both projects using only PATRIC
data and tools. These applications encompass a broad range of the data
and analysis tools available, illustrating practical uses of PATRIC for
the biologist. Finally, a summary is provided of PATRIC’s outreach
activities, collaborative endeavors, and future research directions.
