Global Search
=============

Overview
--------

PATRIC provides a Global Search capability to quickly locate data of interest. Searches return top matches grouped by data type. Searches can be restricted to specific data types and combinations of search terms

Accessing the Global Search on the PATRIC Website
-------------------------------------------------

The Global Search box is available on the right side of the menu bar at the top of each PATRIC page.

Using the Global Search
-----------------------
Entering a search term in the Global Search box and either pressing <Enter> or clicking the magnifying glass icon will start the search. Matching results are returned with a summary information box at the top of the page, and matching top results grouped by data type further down the page. Clicking on the summary result numbers will display page(s) containing those results.  Clicking on a specific item will display that particular result.

Refining Searches
-----------------

Global searches can be refined in several ways:

**Limiting by Data Type**

Clicking the drop-down list on the left side of the Global Search box allows filtering to a particular data type, such as Genomes, Features, Specialty Genes, Taxa, Transcriptomics Experiments, and Antibiotics

Features of the Global Search include:

-  Top matches, sorted by data types, including genomes, genomic
   features, taxa, specialty genes, and transcriptomics experiments.
   Clicking on the number beside the data type section headers returns
   all matching data for that type.
-  Data type specific searches. Pre-filter results to specific data
   types by clicking the down arrow on the left side of the search box.
-  Add additional search conditions using keywords AND, OR, and
   parentheses '( )'. Note that multiple search terms are 'AND'ed
   together by default (each term must be in the item for it to have a
   match). Return only exact matches to the search term by enclosing it
   in quotes
-  Search a specific data field for a particular value by using
   field:value in the search box. For example, entering
   genome_id:123434.3 will search only the genome_id field in the
   database for the term "123434.3"
