The Republic of Moldova is now suffering one of the most severe MDR-TB epidemics in the world. Between 2007 and 2010, greater than 23% of new cases and 60% of previously treated cases were MDR-TB. In an attempt to mitigate the impact of this crisis, Moldova has invested in a robust surveillance system that includes drug susceptibility tests for all individuals with culture-positive TB, an electronic medical record (EMR) that links laboratory, clinical, demographic, and location data for each patient, and a M. tuberculosis specimen storage facility that is linked to the EMR and contains frozen isolates from most patients with culture-positive TB.

These countrywide specimen and data repositories offer an unprecedented opportunity for a high-resolution investigation of the transmission dynamics of MDR-TB in one of the highest risk settings in the world.

While analysis of routine clinical and laboratory data clearly illustrate the heterogeneous distribution of MDR-TB in Moldova and identify transmission (and intra-institutional transmission in particular) as potential contributors to this crisis, higher resolution methods for characterizing the pathogen (beyond the phenotypic classification based on drug susceptibility) are needed to clarify the mechanisms by which MDR-TB continues to emerge within Moldova and why the situation appears to be worsening despite recent efforts to address this crisis. Advances in sequencing, computational approaches for reconstructing disease transmission chains from genetic data, and geospatial analytic methods make it feasible to infer patterns of disease transmission at a much greater detail than previously possible.

We will apply these new approaches to a number of Moldovan strains selected from all notified culture-positive TB cases in a high MDR burden setting to answer questions of both local and global relevance. Analysis of the results from this study will provide important insights into the transmission dynamics of drug resistant TB in Moldova.
