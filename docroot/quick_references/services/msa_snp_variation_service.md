# Multiple Sequence Alignment and SNP/Variation Analysis Service

## Overview
The Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) and Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP)/Variation Analysis Service allows users to choose an alignment algorithm to align sequences selected from: a search result, a FASTA file saved to the workspace, or through simply cutting and pasting. The service can also be used for variation and SNP analysis with feature groups, FASTA files, aligned FASTA files, and user input FASTA records. If a single alignment file is given, then only the variation analysis is run. If multiple inputs are given, the program concatenates all sequence records and aligns them. If a mixture of protein and nucleotides are given, then nucleotides are converted to proteins.

## Using the Multiple Sequence Alignment and Variation/SNP Analysis Service
The **Multiple Sequence Alignment** submenu option under the **"SERVICES"** main menu (Viral Services category) opens the MSA and SNP/Variation Service input form. *Note: You must be logged into BV-BRC to use this service.*
