Workshops
==========
BV-BRC provides workshops to give hands-on instruction in the use of BV-BRC analysis tools and website features.  Workshops can be customized to focus on particular types of analysis, specific organisms, targeted biological systems, or data sets of interest to the participants. 

BV-BRC typically hosts four open workshops annually: two at Argonne National Laboratory in the suburbs of Chicago, IL, one at the J. Craig Venter Institute in La Jolla, California. , and one at the University of Virginia Biocomplexity Institute in Charlottesville, Virginia. The BV-BRC team can occasionally travel to an onsite location provided that the requesting host can draw at least 40 participants, allow open registration (not limited to host organization members only), and provide an appropriate training room with fast Internet access. Note that all BV-BRC workshops require pre-approval by our sponsor, NIAID, and are limited in number by available funds. International workshops require special permission.
