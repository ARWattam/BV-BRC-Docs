**Abstract**
============

We present the draft genome for the Rickettsia endosymbiont of Ixodes
scapularis (REIS), a symbiont of the deer tick vector of Lyme disease in
North America. Among Rickettsia species (Alphaproteobacteria:
Rickettsiales) REIS has the largest genome sequenced to date (>2Mb) and
contains 2309 genes across the chromosome and four plasmids (pREIS1-4).
The most remarkable finding within the REIS genome is the extraordinary
proliferation of mobile genetic elements (MGEs), which contributes to a
limited synteny with other Rickettsia genomes. In particular, an
integrative conjugative element named RAGE (Rickettsiales amplified
genetic element), previously identified in scrub typhus rickettsiae
(Orientia tsutsugamushi) genomes, is present on both the REIS chromosome
and plasmids. Unlike the pseudogene-laden RAGEs of O. tsutsugamushi,
REIS encodes nine conserved RAGEs that include F-like type IV secretion
systems similar to the tra genes encoded in the R. bellii and R.
massiliae genomes. An unparalleled abundance of encoded transposases
(>650) relative to genome size, together with the RAGEs and other MGEs,
comprise ∼35% of the total genome, making REIS one of the most plastic
and repetitive bacterial genomes sequenced to date. We present evidence
that conserved rickettsial genes associated with an intracellular
lifestyle were acquired via MGEs, especially the RAGE, through a
continuum of genomic invasions. Robust phylogeny estimation suggests
REIS is ancestral to the virulent spotted fever group rickettsiae. As
REIS is not known to invade vertebrate cells and has no known pathogenic
effects on I. scapularis, its genome sequence provides insight on the
origin of mechanisms of rickettsial pathogenicity.
