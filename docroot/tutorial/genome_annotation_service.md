# Genome Annotation in PATRIC

The Genome Annotation Service uses the RAST tool kit (RASTtk) [1] to provide annotation of 
genomic features. All genomes in PATRIC have been annotated with this service, and 
researchers can submit their own private genome to the annotation service, where it will be 
deposited into their private workspace for their perusal.

## Locating the Annotation Service App.
1. At the top of any PATRIC page, find the Services tab.
