Unique and Divergent Proteins in E. coli Outbreak Strains
=========================================================

Note:  Data was updated June 17th.

The proteins from the *Escherichia coli* strains TY-2482 and LB226692
were used to search a specific *E. coli* database (compiled with 184 *E.
coli* genomes at PATRIC) using BLAST.  We calculated Smith-Waterman
alignment scores for each of the top ten best-scoring homologs of these
proteins and normalized the score to the self-alignment score, creating
a conformity score.  Conformity scores of 1 mean that all proteins in
the alignment are identical.  Proteins with conformity scores of 0.8 or
less were considered to be “divergent” from their top ten homologs in
*E. coli*.  A graphical representation, where conformity scores for over
5000 proteins of the *E. coli* strains TY-2482 and LB226692, is provided
in the figure below. The X-axis is in log scale.

A list of all proteins and their conformity scores is provided in an
Excel file
(`TY2482-LB226692_Vir_ABR_Conformity_All <http://enews.patricbrc.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/TY2482-LB226692_Vir_ABR_Conformity_All.xls>`__). 
Some of the proteins found in TY-2482 and LB226692 have no homologs in
*E. coli*.  In the conformity score column, these “unique” proteins are
identified by a “-“.  The data for the unique proteins for both species
are also integrated into the PATRIC website
`here <http://www.patricbrc.org/patric/html/ehec_2011.html>`__, with the
additional functionality the site provides.

The divergent proteins (see above) were compared to virulence and
antibiotic-resistance proteins collected from different sources with
some interesting discoveries.  For example, beta-lactamase, a protein
responsible for resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics like penicillins,
cephamycins, and carbapenems was found to be identical in TY-2482 and
LB226692 (CTX-M type), but very different from their closest homologs
prevalent in other *E. coli* strains (TEM-type).  An alignment of these
proteins is provided
`here <http://www.patricbrc.org/patric/html/ehec_2011.html#alignment>`__. 
Other divergent proteins include ABC transporters, phage-related and
outermembrane proteins.
