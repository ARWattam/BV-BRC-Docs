# BLAST Service

## Accessing the BLAST Service on the PATRIC Website

The BLAST Service can be accessed from the SERVICES tab on the PATRIC
homepage. The BLAST Search allows you to search against public or
private genomes in PATRIC or other reference databases using a DNA or
protein sequence and find matching genomes, genes, RNAs, or proteins.

Clicking on BLAST from the SERVICES tab will open up the BLAST landing
page where researchers can do nucleotide or amino acid BLAST searches.

-   Loading a sequence. Cut and paste a sequence into the Sequence box.
-   Choosing a type of BLAST. Depending upon the sequence, this will
    open the drop down box under Program, showing the types of BLAST
    available. Definitions of the types of BLAST searches are as
    follows:
    -   BLAST: searches nucleotide databases using a nucleotide query
    -   BLASTP: searcesh protein databases using a protein query
    -   BLASTX: searches protein databases using a translated nucleotide
        query
    -   TBLASTX: searches translated nucleotide databases using a
        translated nucleotide query
    -   TBLASTN: searches translated nucleotide subjects using a protein
        query
-   Selecting a database. PATRIC provides a variety of databases that
    selected sequences can be compared to.
-   BLASTing against gene features or contigs. Depending upon query
    type, researchers will be able to choose to search entire genomes or
    limit the search to only features. When BLASTN, TBLASTN, or TBLASTX
    are selected, researchers can choose to search against either
    contigs or features. When BLASTP or BLASTX are selected, the search
    is limited to features.
-   Adjusting the BLAST parameters. You may use the Advanced Options to
    adjust both the number of hits returned, and the E value threshold.
-   Submitting the BLAST job. Once the sequence has been uploaded, the
    program and database selected, the BLAST parameters adjusted, the
    job can be started by clicking the Search button at the bottom of
    the page.
-   Submitting another BLAST job. At the top of the BLAST result page,
    researchers can click on the Edit from and resubmit button to
    initiate another BLAST job.
