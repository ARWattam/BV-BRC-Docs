# Comparative Systems Tool

## Overview
The Comparative Systems Tool allows users to identify a set of pathways, subsystems, and protein families for a set of genomes or genome groups. It combines together functionality from three different tools and data from the legacy PATRIC system: the **Protein Family Sorter**, **Pathway Comparison**, and **Subsystems Data**.
