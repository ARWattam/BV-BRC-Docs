# PATRIC Jobs

## Overview
For most PATRIC services, when the service starts, it creates a computational "job" that runs on back-end high-performance computers which perform the analysis and return the results back to the user via the website or command line interface. The reason for this is that many services, such as Genome Annotation and Genome Assembly, require a significant amount of computational power and time to complete. The job display provides information on the status of the computation: queued, running, completed, or failed.

## Accessing Job Status Information and Results in the PATRIC Website
If a user is logged in, a small Jobs Indicator box is always displayed at the bottom right of the PATRIC website.

The Jobs Indicator box provides a compact view of the status of current and prior jobs.
