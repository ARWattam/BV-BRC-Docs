Tuberculosis (TB), and especially drug resistant TB in Sweden is most often found in the immigrant population. More than 90% of all MDR and all detected XDR-TB cases were found in immigrants. During the last 10-year period we have seen an increase in the number of cases of TB. The number of detected MDR-TB patients has increased from around 5 cases per year to between 15-20 per year.

Strains (clinical isolates) included in the study: The study material includes a complete collection of all 141 MDR/XDR-TB strains identified nationwide in Sweden during the period 2003-2013. These strains will be available from the BEI Resources Repository. Detailed information of the drug resistance for up to 15 different anti-TB agents, in some cases with additional data on MIC-values, as well as molecular fingerprinting data and epidemiological cluster information are available for all strains. Moreover, detailed clinical information, including the national origin, site and type of infection, treatment and outcome data, are available from the individual patients from whom these strains were isolated. Having these data on the bacteria as well as on the patients is an important source of information that can be analyzed in detail for selected cases when interesting genetic data is found. For comparison, 12 selected (mainly first isolate from each year 2003-2013) pan susceptible isolates are also included.
