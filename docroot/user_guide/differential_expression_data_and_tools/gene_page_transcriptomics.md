# Gene Page Transcriptomics Data

## Gene Page Transcriptomics Data Overview

The Transcriptomics Tab at the gene-level summarizes the expression of a
gene in all available experimental datasets. All the comparisons in
which a gene is differentially expressed are listed in a table along
with associated metadata such as Strain, Gene Modification, and
Experimental Condition. Expression value based filters and a graphical
summary of the experimental metadata allow you to quickly find top
experimental conditions and gene manipulations related to the
differential expression of the gene. This may help to confirm or infer
potential function of the gene.

## Accessing Gene-Level Transcriptomics Data

Gene-level transcriptomics data is available under the Transcriptomics
Tab on any given Gene Overview Landing page. You may search for your
gene/CDS of interest using PATRIC’s Global Search and then go directly
to the corresponding Gene Overview Landing page.

## Using Transcriptomics Data at the Gene Level

-   The data may be filtered, via the controls above the graphs, in the
    following ways:
    -   Use the keyword search box to find the comparisons with matching
        descriptions or metadata. Some examples of keywords: "mutant",
        "*rpoS"*, "temperature", and "oxygen".
    -   Apply the |Log Ratio| and/or |Z-score| cut-off to see only those
        comparisons in which the gene expression passes the cut-off.
        This, in addition to the graphical summary of the metadata,
        allows for quickly locating experimental conditions that cause
        significant differential expression of the gene.
    -   Reset the filters back to the default mode or click on Show All
        Comparisons to see all the comparisons in which the gene is
        reported.
-   The Log Ratio and Z-score distribution graphs provide a quick visual
    summary of the number of comparisons in which the gene is
    significantly expressed.
-   The pie/bar graph of key metadata attributes, such as Strain, Gene
    Modification, and Experimental Condition allows for quickly locating
    top gene modifications or experimental conditions causing
    differential expression of the gene.
-   The table below the graphs lists all comparisons matching the
    current filtering criteria. It provides link-outs to corresponding
    NCBI publications (PubMed) and GEO experiment pages (Accession). The
    table may be sorted based on any of the columns or downloaded as a
    text/Excel file.

## Correlated Genes?

For a gene of interest, the Correlated Genes tab shows a list of genes
that have correlated expression profiles (positively or negatively)
across all available data sets along with their functions. Thus,
researchers may identify genes that are co-regulated or have similar
functions. It can also help to infer potential function of a
hypothetical or unknown gene.

## Working with Lists of Correlated Genes

-   Filter the list by specifying any correlation cut-off (between 0
    and 1) and positive/negative correlation.
-   Use the Gene List Table Toolbar located in the light blue row to:◦
    -   Save selected items to groups within your Workspace by clicking
        the Add Feature(s) button. To learn more about how to save data
        for future visits and utilize your personal Workspace see
        [Workspace FAQs](/content/Workspace_and_Groups).
    -   View or download selected DNA and/or protein sequence data in
        FASTA format. The individual tables themselves, or selected data
        within them, are also downloadable in both excel and txt file
        formats.
    -   View pathways and associated pathway information for your
        selected genes by clicking the Pathway Summary button.
    -   Conduct Multiple Sequence Alignment analysis on selected groups,
        or selected items within groups, by clicking the Multiple
        Sequence Alignment button. For more details on this tool please
        see [Multiple Sequence Alignment FAQs](/content/Multiple_Sequence_Alignment).
    -   Utilize the ID Mapping Tool on selected items by clicking the
        Map IDs button. For more information on this tool please see [ID Mapping FAQs.](/content/ID_Mapping_Tool)
    -   Customize columns shown/hidden in your results table with the
        Columns button.
