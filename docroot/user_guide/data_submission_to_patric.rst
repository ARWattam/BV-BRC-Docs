Data Submission to PATRIC
==================================

How to submit data to PATRIC
-----------------------------

PATRIC provides a repository of genomic and other data types, collected
and integrated from multiple sources including public repositories,
special studies, and individual researchers. There are two methods for
depositing and making your data available in PATRIC:

To make your data fully integrated and publicly available in PATRIC
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Please contact the PATRIC team at help@patricbrc.org and we will work
with you to incorporate your data along with the associated metadata
that will enhance its search-ability and enable advanced comparative
analyses with other PATRIC data. Currently supported data types include
those listed below. Other data types can potentially be included as
downloadable files on the `PATRIC FTP
server <ftp://ftp.patricbrc.org/patric2>`__.

-  Genomes (annotated with the `PATRIC Genome Annotation
   Service </app/Annotation>`__)
-  Gene annotations, which will be associated with the corresponding
   gene in PATRIC as a structured assertion on the gene page
-  Expression data, including microarray, protein, and RNA-Seq
-  Tn-Seq data
-  Protein-protein interactions

To upload your data into a PATRIC workspace for analysis or sharing with other registered PATRIC users
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`Register at PATRIC <https://user.patricbrc.org/register>`__ and log in.
You will then be able to upload your data into a private workspace and
use the analysis tools listed below. You can also create special
workspace for sharing with specific other registered users, or share as
a "`public workspace </workspace/public>`__" available to all other
registered users who are logged in.
