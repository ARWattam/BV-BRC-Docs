The default workspace is called "home," which is the top level workspace containing all the files, folders, and job results for the logged in user. Additional shared workspaces may also be available (see Shared Workspaces below).

The table in the workspace lists the Names of folders and files, their Size (files only), the Owner ("me" unless the file or folder was shared by another user), other Members (users) with whom the workspace is shared, and when the file or folder was Created. 

Initially, the home workspace is pre-populated with several folders that correspond to common PATRIC data types and are the default locations for data of those type, listed below. Additional custom folders can be created using the Add Folder button at the top right of the workspace table.
