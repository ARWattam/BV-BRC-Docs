PATRIC/RAST Workshop at ASM Microbe, June 7, 2018, Atlanta, GA
=========================================================================

.. feed-entry::
   :date: 2018-04-04

The PATRIC/RAST teams will be offering a tutorial workshop June 7, 2018, at ASM Microbe 2018 in Atlanta, GA. The workshop will run for one day and will cover key functionality of the PATRIC system.

.. cut::

The tutorial will show participants how to assemble a genome from reads, annotate that genome, and then compare that genome to the public genomes available in PATRIC using a suite of comparative analysis tools. In addition, participants will be able to load and analyze RNA-Seq data, use PATRIC's new Metagenomic Binning Service, and annotate sequence variations. BLAST service.  Participants will also learn to use PATRIC’s newest services including building phylogenetic trees, that include the ability to build a phylogenetic tree using PATRIC’s new tree-building pipeline, and do analysis of Tn-Seq data.

Registration through ASM 2018 is required.  Registration information can be found on the `ASM 2018 registration page
