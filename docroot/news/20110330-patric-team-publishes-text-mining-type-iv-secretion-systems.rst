**Abstract**

Research on specialized biological systems is often hampered by a lack
of consistent terminology, especially across species. In bacterial Type
IV secretion systems genes within one set of orthologs may have over a
dozen different names. Classifying research publications based on
biological processes, cellular components, molecular functions, and
microorganism species should improve the precision and recall of
literature searches allowing researchers to keep up with the
exponentially growing literature, through resources such as the
Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC, patricbrc.org). We
developed named entity recognition (NER) tools for four entities related
to Type IV secretion systems: 1) bacteria names, 2) biological
processes, 3) molecular functions, and 4) cellular components. These
four entities are important to pathogenesis and virulence research but
have received less attention than other entities, e.g., genes and
proteins. Based on an annotated corpus, large domain terminological
resources, and machine learning techniques, we developed recognizers for
these entities. High accuracy rates (>80%) are achieved for bacteria,
biological processes, and molecular function. Contrastive experiments
highlighted the effectiveness of alternate recognition strategies;
results of term extraction on contrasting document sets demonstrated the
utility of these classes for identifying T4SS-related documents.
